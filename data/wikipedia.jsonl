{"eng_Latn":"Saint Asella, also known as Osella and Ocella (c. 334\u2013c. 406), was a Roman virgin and hermit who was a disciple and friend of Saint Jerome, who spoke of her in his writings.  She was a member of a noble and wealthy Roman Christian family, perhaps the sister of Marcella, another ascetic and  saint.\n\nLife\nWhen Asella was ten years old, she heard St. Athanasius speak during his third and final visit to Rome, and that, already being a \"pious child\", inspired her to \"dedicate her life to the service of Christ\".  At first, her parents would not allow her to wear the garments usually worn by ascetics, but she secretly sold a gold necklace, paid for the garment's production, and when she was 12, surprised her parents by appearing to them in \"this garb of consecration\".\n\nFrom that time on, Asella lived in silence and seclusion, living in a small cell, sleeping on the ground or on a stone, upon which she also prayed.  She fasted all year, living on bread, salt, and water, often eating nothing for two or three days, and would fast for many weeks at a time during Lent.  She lived a life of self-isolation, leaving her cell only to visit the churches of the martyrs, and often without being seen by others, and rarely by her own sister. According to historian Claude Fleury, Asella never spoke to any man. As hagiographer Agnes Dunbar stated, \"She worked with her hands and sang psalms\". Despite her austere lifestyle, it did not affect her health; Jerome wrote that \"with a sound body and even sounder soul, she found for herself a monkish cell in the midst of a busy Rome\".  Fleury also said about Asella: \"Her life was simple and regular, and in the midst of Rome led a life of perfect solitude\". Jerome also cited Asella as an example and role model for young women, widows, and virgins, calling her \"a flower of the Lord\".\n\nAfter leaving Rome for the East in August 385, Jerome wrote to Asella from on board ship at Ostia to refute the calumnies by which he had been assailed, especially as regards his intimacy with Paula and Eustochium. \n\nIn 405, the bishop and historian Palladius of Galatia visited Rome and met Asella, who was 70 years old.  He called her \"the gentlest of women\", and reported that she was in charge of a community of nuns.  Asella died c. 406; her feast day is December 6.\n\nReferences\n\nWorks cited \n Dunbar, Agnes B.C. (1901). A Dictionary of Saintly Women. Volume 1.

{"eng_Latn":"Test match number 1073, described as, one of the greatest and most dramatic Test matches between India and Pakistan, it was the fifth and final Test of the Pakistani tour of India. The match was won by Pakistan by 16 runs after the previous four matches had ended in draws. It was the final Test played by India's Sunil Gavaskar.\n\nDetails\n\nDay 1 \u2013 13 March\nAs Sunil Gavaskar was playing his final Test match the Indian captain Kapil Dev allowed him to take part in the toss as a token of respect. Pakistan's Imran Khan won the toss and chose to bat first. After Kapil Dev dismissed opening batsman Rizwan-uz-Zaman for 1, Pakistan had a second wicket partnership of 36 runs between Rameez Raja and Saleem Malik. Pakistan then lost six wickets for just 14 runs with Maninder Singh claiming five wickets, leaving Pakistan on 74 for 8. Pakistan fought back, adding 42 runs for the last two wickets before being all out for 116 in just 49.2 overs. For India Maninder Singh claimed 7 wickets for 27 runs with Kapil Dev (2) and Ravi Shastri claiming the other wickets.\n\nAfter an opening wicket partnership of 39 between Gavaskar and Srikkanth, India finished the day on 68 for 2 with Mohinder Amarnath and Dilip Vengsarkar remained unbeaten on 12 and 9 runs respectively.\n\nDay 2 \u2013 14 March\nIndia soon gained a lead over Pakistan and at one stage were 126 for 4 before being dismissed for 145 runs, a lead of only 29 runs. Vengsarkar made a patient 50, but no other Indian batsmen made a double digit score. Both Pakistani spin bowlers Iqbal Qasim and Tauseef Ahmed claimed five wickets each.\n\nIn their second innings, Pakistan had a safe start with Javed Miandad opening the innings along with Saleem Malik. An opening wicket partnership of 45 runs set of solid foundation before Pakistan fell to 155 for 5 at the end of the day, an overall lead of 126 runs.\n\nDay 3 \u2013 15 March\nThree wickets fell on the morning of the third day, with captain Imran the eight Pakistani batsman dismissed with the score on 198 for 8, a lead of 169 runs. Saleem Yousuf, scoring 41 runs, and Tauseef Ahmed added 51 runs for the ninth wicket before the side were bowled out for 249 runs, leaving India a target of 221 runs with the pitch becoming very difficult for the batsmen. For India, Ravi Shastri claimed four wickets, Maninder three and Yadav two.\n\nPakistan shocked India with two early wickets as Wasim Akram dismissed Srikkanth and Amarnath in successive deliveries with India reeling at 15 for 2. Vengsarkar joined Gavaskar and their partnership made 49 runs before Vengsarkar was clean bowled by Tauseef with Indian score reading 64 for 3. Wicket-keeper Kiran More was sent in as night watchman, but he was out for 3 and at the end of the third day India were 99 for 4 with Azharuddin and Gavaskar on 7 and 51 runs respectively, needing another 122 runs to win.\n\nDay 4 \u2013 17 March\nOn the rest day (16 March), Pakistan bowlers Iqbal Qasim and Tauseef Ahmed happened to meet Bishan Singh Bedi at a reception, who advised them not to try too much on the turning pitch.\n \nOn the fourth day India resumed their innings on a crumbling pitch. Gavaskar and Azharuddin brought the target under 100 runs, but Azharuddin was brilliantly caught and bowled by Iqbal Qasim for 26. Shastri had a 30 runs partnership with Gavaskar as he was caught and bowled, again by Iqbal Qasim at the score on 155. After Kapil Dev was out for two, India went to lunch on 161\/7, still needing 60 runs to win. After adding 19 runs after lunch, Sunil Gavaskar was controversially given out caught off of his wrist for 96 in his final Test innings. India still needed another 41 runs to win, but lost Shivlal Yadav for four and last man Maninder Singh joined Roger Binny with 36 more runs needed to win. Binny counter attacked Tauseef with a six, but was caught by Saleem Yousuf off Tauseef Ahmed for 15 as India were bowled out for 204 runs, Pakistan winning the match by 16 runs.\n\nThe match was the only one of the five-match series which ended in a victory, meaning Pakistan won the series 1\u20130.

Although witnesses have provided detailed accounts of the murder it remains unsolved.\n\nTrial of Sir Ga\u00ebtan Duval \nIn 1989 two ex-prisoners Paul Sarah and Moorgesh Shummoogum alleged in a statement to the police that in 1971 Sir Gaetan Duval had planned and commandeered the murder of Azor Adelaide at his Grand-Gaube bungalow. They made the police statement at the police station located  outside then Prime Minister Sir Aneerood Jugnauth's residence at La Caverne, Vacoas.  Paul Sarah, Moorgesh Shummoogum, Ignace Bahloo and Andr\u00e9 Celestin had already served prison sentences for their involvement in the 1971 murder.\n\nDuring the afternoon of 23 June 1989 Duval landed at Plaisance Airport in Mauritius from Madagascar and he was questioned by Superintendent of Police Reesaul of the Anti Drug and Smuggling Unit (ADSU). Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Cyril Morvan was also travelling on the same flight.\n\nDuval was escorted to Line Barracks in Port Louis where he was arrested on murder charges.

{"eng_Latn":"Harding Mountain is a   mountain summit located in Chelan County of Washington state. It is the seventh-highest point in the North Wenatchee Mountains. Harding Mountain is situated within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness,  northwest of Mount Stuart, and  west of Eightmile Mountain, on land managed by Wenatchee National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of Icicle Creek, which in turn is a tributary of the Wenatchee River. This mountain was named after President Warren G. Harding by Albert Hale Sylvester.\n\nClimate\n\nLying east of the Cascade crest, the area around Harding Mountain is a bit drier than areas to the west. Summers can bring warm temperatures and occasional thunderstorms. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the eastern slopes of the Cascades experience lower precipitation than the western slopes. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.\n\nGeology\n\nThe Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes.  Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences.\n\nThe history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. Harding Mountain is part of the Mount Stuart batholith.\n\nDuring the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving  deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada\u2013US border by 10,000 years ago. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.\n\nSee also\n\nList of peaks of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness\nGeology of the Pacific Northwest\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Harding Mountain:  weather forecast\n\nMountains of Chelan County, Washington\nMountains of Washington (state)\nWenatchee National Forest\nCascade Range\nNorth American 2000 m summits"}
{"eng_Latn":"The Diocese of Dacia Felix (; ) is the Romanian Orthodox diocese of the Romanians in Serbia (including the Timok Vlachs).\n\nHistory\nIn 1971, the Romanian parishes in the Serbian Banat were merged into a vicariate the center of which was Vr\u0161ac (), Serbia, and which was part of the Metropolis of Banat. This vicariate would later be ascended to the Diocese of Dacia Felix in 1997. The city of Deta in Romania was chosen as its official center, while Vr\u0161ac remained as the administrative headquarters.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the diocese began to expand its influence over the Timok Valley, region that the Serbian Orthodox Church considers its own. On 31 March 2001, Daniil Stoenescu became the bishop of the diocese. In 2005, the first temple in the Timok Valley with services performed in Romanian was built. Serbian authorities viewed it as illegal and attempted to demolish it, but did not do so due to external pressure. The diocese was withdrawn from the Metropolis of Banat in 2009 to be directly subordinate to the Patriarch of All Romania. On 1 August 2017, Siluan M\u0103nuil\u0103, bishop of the Diocese of Gyula in Hungary, became leader of the diocese due to health problems of Stoenescu.

{"eng_Latn":"Houses of Hermes is a supplement published by Wizards of the Coast in 1994 for the third edition of the fantasy role-playing game Ars Magica.\n\nDescription\nHouses of Hermes describes the twelve major houses of wizards that together form the Order of Hermes. Each house is dealt with in detail, including its origins and history, and notable personalities. A plot connected to each house is described, and several story hooks are also provided. The book also details new spells and abilities from each house. In addition, the general system of apprenticeship that all the houses use is described.\n\nPublication history\nThe first edition of Ars Magica was designed by Jonathan Tweet and Mark Rein-Hagen and published in 1987 by Lion Rampant. In 1991, Lion Rampant merged with White Wolf Magazine to form White Wolf Game Studio, which produced a greatly expanded third edition. In 1994, Wizards of the Coast was interested in buying a role-playing game system that could be updated and expanded, and asked designer Jonathan Tweet about Ars Magica. As game historian Shannon Appelcline described it in the 2014 book Designers & Dragons: The '90s, \"Wizards consulted with Tweet, and after some thought, he recommended the purchase \u2014 which was completed around January 1994.\"\n\nWhile Tweet worked on a revised fourth edition of Ars Magica for WotC, he also designed for them Houses of Hermes, a 152-page softcover book with additional contributions by Aron Anderson. Interior illustrations were by Liz Danforth, John T. Snyder, Mark Tedin, Susan Van Camp, and Eric Hotz, and the cover art was by Rob Alexander. And although the cover of Houses of Hermes was subtitled \"A Sourcebook for Ars Magica 4th Edition\", the game mechanics described in it are for White Wolf's 3rd edition. As Appelcline noted, \"Ironically, the game that Tweet co-created would end up being one of Wizard's least supported lines, with just two books: Houses of Hermes (1994) and Lion of the North (1994). Nonetheless, Wizards did make a very permanent mark on the Ars Magica line. They put together a massive, cleaned-up, and codified fourth edition. They just never published it.\"\n\nReception\nIn the September 1995 edition of Dragon (Issue #221), Rick Swan liked the fact that this book \"downplays dreary historical summaries in favor of engaging profiles of master magicians [...] The characters make great adversaries and advisors.\" Swan was also pleased by \"the intriguing sidebars\", saying that they \"supply referees with adventure hooks galore.\"\n\nOther reviews\nArs Mag, Issue 5 (Sept 1995, p.\u00a024)\n\nReferences\n\nArs Magica supplements\nRole-playing game supplements introduced in 1994"}

{"eng_Latn":"Farewill is a private company that provides will-writing, probate, and cremation services in the UK, based in London. Founded in 2015. It claims to be the UK's biggest will writer. Farewill is registered in England and Wales with the Law Society and was declared the National Will Writing Firm of the year in 2019. \n\nIt is a B2C product but is also provided as a free service through several charities.\n\nHistory\nFarewill was founded in 2015 by Dan Garrett (Co-Founder & CEO) and Tom Rogers (Co-Founder & CPTO). Garrett started the company after being inspired whilst designing new products for elderly residents in a care home in Tokyo. \n\nDan Garrett returned to the UK and moved into the death industry, where he organised 15 funerals and gained a qualification in will writing, founding Farewill on July 24, 2015 to \"make [death care] easier\". \n\nIn 2016, following their seed funding round, Tracy Doree, angel investor and founder of venture capital firm Kindred Capital, joined Farewill as its Chairperson. In addition to Tracy, the company has 3 additional Directors: Tom Rogers, its Chief Product and Technology Officer (CPTO), Tim Levene of Augmentum Fintech and Dan Garrett, the CEO.\n\nIn 2019, Farewill was listed as one of Rocketlist's Top 20 Companies to Work For, Fintech50's Hottest Fintechs to watch, and Sifted's Top UK Startups to follow in 2020. It was awarded best social innovation at the Europas in 2020. \n\nAccording to Augmentum Fintech, Farewill grew by 10x between January 2019 and July 2020. Like many other unprofitable tech startups, Farewill announced redundancies in 2022.\n\nFarewill's position in the death industry and work with charities has been a topic of discussion due to Farewill's unregulated status. Farewill's CEO has criticized the sector as \u201covertly traditional\u201d, with prices that are \u201cunaffordably high\u201d. In 2020, the Financial Times questioned the need for new technology in this sector.\n\nServices\n\nDirect\nFarewill offers a number of services, including will-writing (online and over the phone), a direct cremation service, a probate service, and a subscription-based will update service. \n\nFarewill states that users can complete an online will in 15 minutes for \u00a390. An additional service, at \u00a310 per year allows for the same will to be updated an unlimited number of times. The will-writing process is based on questions that the user answers to provide the necessary information. After this, the user goes through a payment process, and then they can download and sign the document in the presence of their chosen witnesses to finally obtain their legal will. \n\nDirect cremations - where the cremation happens privately and the ashes are returned to the family afterwards - start from \u00a3980. This has been reported as being around a third of the UK average cost for direct cremation, and around a fifth of the average UK funeral cost.\n\nIn 2016, TechCrunch wrote of their data privacy concerns of storing wills digitally, online. This led to Farewill responding that user data is stored on Amazon's Secure Storage Service in Ireland and encrypted using AES-256 encryption.\n\nCharity partners\nThe company has partnered with 50 UK charities, including Cancer Research UK, British Heart Foundation, McMillan, The Royal British Legion, and Christian Aid. The charities provide access to the will-writing service to encourage bequeathals to their organisation. \n\nIt is estimated that this has generated over \u00a3260 million in pledged income, across the charities, since Farewill launched.\n\nCEO \u2013 Dan Garrett\nDan Garrett is the chief executive officer and co-founder of Farewill. He completed an MSc in Design at the Royal College of Art, a Master of Structural Engineering at Oxford University, and an MSc in Global Innovation Design at Imperial College London.\n\nGarrett started Farewill after working in a Japanese residential home where he saw what he would later characterize as \u2018the ineffectiveness of the death care industry\u2019.  When he returned to the UK, prior to starting Farewill, he organised 15 funerals and obtained will-writing qualifications.\n\nDan Garrett was the 2019 winner of the Legal Innovation Awards Outstanding Innovator Award.\n\nResponse to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Farewill saw demand for direct cremations increase by 300% and demand for wills 12 times higher than normal. \n\nFarewill campaigned with former rugby player Gareth Thomas for an update to legislation on wills, as rules requiring wills to be witnessed were proving impractical due to social distancing measures. The Ministry of Justice investigated temporarily pausing such requirements.\n\nFrom April 1, 2020, Farewill began providing free will-writing services to all NHS staff. It was reported in July 2020 that over 15,000 NHS workers had used the free wills service.\n\nFunding and investors\n \nFarewill has raised \u00a330M in total. \n\nAfter a number of seed rounds, a series A round occurred In January 2019, which raised \u00a37.5M from 10 investors. This was said to be used to double the size of Farewill's workforce.\n\nOn 8 July 2020, the company raised another Series B Round funding, led by venture capital firm Highland Europe. This round totalled \u00a320 million, at what is believed to be a \u00a370 million valuation, and was said to be used to expand and improve the service offering through the UK. Notable investors in this round included Keen Venture Partners, Richard Pierson of Headspace, Broadhaven Capital Partners and VentureFunders. \n\nAfter making a net loss of \u00a34.5m in 2020, a net loss of \u00a36.8m in 2021 and a net loss of \u00a37.5m in 2022, Farewill crowdfunded in 2023 at a valuation of \u00a325,775,000 - a reduction of 63% on the 2020 funding round.\n\nCurrent investors publicly invested in Farewill are Alex Chesterman, Augmentum Fintech, DMG Ventures, Broadhaven Capital Partners, Errol Damelin, Highland Europe, Jamjar Investments, Keen Venture Partners, Kindred Capital, Microsoft, Richard Pierson (of Headspace), SAATCHIiNVEST, SBRI Healthcare, Taaveet Hinrikus, TinyVC, Tracy Terrill, Taavet Hinrikus of TransferWise and VentureFounders.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nWills and trusts in the United Kingdom\nBritish companies established in 2015\n2015 establishments in England\nInternet properties established in 2015\nHaggerston\nFinancial services companies established in 2015"}

{"eng_Latn":"Operation Fenix was an operation launched by militants of the KLA's \"cobra\" unit, which conducted two ambushes out of Albanian territory near the border outpost of Koshare on Yugoslav forces. Six Yugoslav Army personnel were killed. The KLA suffered no casualties, and captured Yugoslav ammunition, equipment and robbed the dead soldiers.\n\nBackground \nIn 1989, Belgrade abolished self-rule in Serbia's two autonomous provinces, Vojvodina and Kosovo. Kosovo, a province inhabited predominantly by ethnic Albanians, was of great historical and cultural significance to Serbs. Prior to the mid-19th century they had formed a majority in the province, but by 1990 represented only about 10 percent of the population.  Alarmed by their dwindling numbers, the province's Serbs began to fear they were being \"squeezed out\" by the Albanians, with whom ethnic tensions had been brewing since the early 1980s. As soon as Kosovo's autonomy was abolished, a minority government run by Serbs and Montenegrins was appointed by Serbian President Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to oversee the province, enforced by thousands of heavily armed paramilitaries from Serbia-proper. Albanian culture was systematically repressed and hundreds of thousands of Albanians working in state-owned companies lost their jobs.\n\nIn 1996, a ragtag group of Albanian nationalists calling themselves the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) began attacking the Yugoslav Army (; VJ) and the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs (; MUP) in Kosovo. Their goal was to separate the province from the rest of Yugoslavia, which following the separation of Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1991\u201392, became a rump federation made up of Serbia and Montenegro. At first the KLA carried out hit-and-run attacks: 31 in 1996, 55 in 1997, and 66 in January and February 1998 alone. The group quickly gained popularity among young Kosovo Albanians, many of whom favored a more aggressive approach and rejected the non-violent resistance of politician Ibrahim Rugova. It received a significant boost in 1997 when civil unrest in neighboring Albania led to thousands of weapons from the Albanian Army's depots being looted. Many of these weapons ended up in the hands of the KLA. The group's popularity skyrocketed after the VJ and MUP attacked the compound of KLA leader Adem Jashari in March 1998, killing him, his closest associates and most of his extended family. The attack motivated thousands of young Kosovo Albanians to join the KLA, fueling the Kosovar uprising that eventually erupted in the spring of 1998.\n\nEvents \nThe men, who were part of the KLA's \"Cobra\" unit, first prepared for the ambush by laying anti tank mines. Later, a Yugoslav tank came and detonated one of the anti tank mines. The blast killed one soldier and injured four others. A Yugoslav army helicopter was sent out to pick up the surviving soldiers, but it was fired upon by the KLA. A second attack happened shortly after, this time close to the Ko\u0161are border outpost. The KLA fighters ambushed a Yugoslav army vehicle. They opened fire upon the vehicle and threw hand grenades at it, killing five Yugoslav soldiers and wounding two more. They then collected ammunition and equipment from the vehicle and soldiers and robbed the dead of their personal belongings. The KLA then opened fire to another helicopter which came to evacuate the wounded.\n\nAftermath \n\nThe higher court in the southern Serbian city of Ni\u0161 on February 17, 2016, found Sicer Maloku, Gashi Xhafer, Demush Gacaferi, Deme Maloku, Agron Isufi, Anton Cuni, Rabit Alija and Rrustem Berisha guilty of acts of terrorism and ordered each of them to be jailed for 15 years for their involvement in two attacks on Yugoslav Army troops in Kosare on the same day in 1998. Rrustem Berisha is currently a Kosovar politician and military officer. He is currently the Minister of Defense of Kosovo. he responded to the conviction by saying this; \u201cWe had uniforms. We were soldiers and we fought against soldiers. They [the Yugoslav Army] killed civilians including elderly people, children and women.\" Former Prime Minister of Kosovo Isa Mustafa said that a Serbian court's decision to convict eight former Kosovo Liberation Army fighters of killing Yugoslav Army troops in September 1998 was a farce. Mustafa said that courts in Serbia have no right to judge Kosovo's citizens and even less to try former KLA fighters who were involved in what he called a liberation war and respected the laws and customs of warfare.\n\nNone of the former KLA militants have served the sentence they were given.\n\nReferences \n\nConflicts in 1998\n1998 in Kosovo\n1998 in Yugoslavia\nMilitary operations of the Kosovo War\nBattles involving Albania\nBattles involving FR Yugoslavia\nSerbian\u2013Albanian conflict\nAlbania\u2013Serbia border\nAmbushes in Europe"}

{"eng_Latn":"Raeesah Begum bte Farid Khan (born 10 November 1993) is a Singaporean social activist and former politician. A former member of the opposition Workers' Party (WP), she was the Member of Parliament (MP) representing the Compassvale division of Sengkang GRC between 2020 and 2021. She resigned from the Workers' Party (WP) and as Member of Parliament (MP) on 30 November 2021 after making unsubstantiated allegations in Parliament on three occasions.\n\nEarly life and career \nRaeesah was born in 1993 in Singapore, she is the daughter of ethnic Malay parents of mixed-race ancestry, a marine service businessman named Farid Khan bin Kaim Khan who is of mixed Indian-Pakistani descent and was one of the candidates for the 2017 presidential election and his wife Naeemah Shaik bte Abu Bakar who is of Arab descent.  She has a younger brother, Yusuf Khan.\n\nRaeesah studied economics and marketing at Murdoch University.\n\nIn 2016, she founded the Reyna Movement, an organisation that aims to empower marginalised women and children through up-skilling programs and community engagement. The Reyna Movement has worked with women's shelters, the homeless, at-risk children and low-income families in Singapore.\n\nRaeesah first met Mahadhir Caffoor in 2017. They married on 14 July 2018. Together, they have a son and daughter.\n\nPolitical career \n\nRaeesah became a member of the Workers' Party in 2018, having previously volunteered in the party's grassroots activities. On 30 June 2020, Raeesah was announced as one of the party's four members contesting the Sengkang Group Representation Constituency as part of the 2020 Singaporean general election, alongside Jamus Lim, He Ting Ru, and Louis Chua. She is also the youngest candidate of the party.\n\nPrior to getting elected, two separate police reports were lodged against Raeesah for allegedly making two online comments, both relating to the discrimination of race and religion. WP later came out to support Raeesah; Raeesah also apologised and released a statement stating that her intention was \"never to cause social divisions but to raise awareness on minority issues\", adding that she also regretted making her \"insensitive\" comments. Netizens labelled the bringing up of her past comments as a political move, with hashtags such as \"#IStandWithRaeesah\" trending on Twitter.\n\nTogether with the Workers' Party team contesting in Sengkang GRC, she was subsequently elected with 52.12% of the votes, defeating the People's Action Party in an upset victory that secured a second group representation constituency for the Workers' Party. She was the youngest Member of Parliament in the 14th Parliament of Singapore. On 17 September 2020, the Singapore Police Force issued her with a warning over the posts.\n\nAllegations against the police\nOn 3 August 2021, Raeesah made an allegation against the Singapore Police Force during a parliamentary debate on empowering women. She alleged that in 2018, a police officer had made inappropriate comments about a 25-year-old rape victim whom she had accompanied to make a police report, and gave recommendations to increase sensitivity in investigations. Home Affairs Minister of State Desmond Tan subsequently said that the allegations are serious and needed investigation. When asked for details, Raeesah declined, saying that she did not wish to retraumatise the victim, affirming that the anecdote was not an isolated case. She also agreed to file a parliamentary question if it was about questions related to the issue, adding that the speech was not to cast aspersions on the police and clarifying later that the police can be the solution. She also said she was unsuccessful in contacting the victim after the incident happened, adding that she would communicate directly with the Ministry of Home Affairs in the future if a similar situation occurred. \n\nOn 4 October 2021, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said the police had checked their records and found no cases that fit Raeesah's description, so he asked her to provide more details about the alleged mishandling of the case. In response, Raeesah reaffirmed her statement but, citing concerns about confidentiality, declined to reveal any further details, including the police station they went to. On 20 October 2021, the police said that an extensive search had not managed to identify the case in question, adding that Raeesah had also not responded to their requests to provide more details about the case.\n\nOn 1 November 2021, Raeesah admitted that she had lied on three occasions about the alleged incident in Parliament. She had not accompanied the victim to make a police report, and had heard about it from a support group for women who had been victims of sexual assault. She also did not have the victim's consent to share the incident in Parliament. In explaining why she had lied, Raeesah claimed that she had been sexually assaulted when she was 18 while studying abroad. In response, Leader of the House Indranee Rajah expressed sympathy towards Raeesah but raised an official complaint against her for breaching her parliamentary privilege and asked for the matter to be referred to the Committee of Privileges. As Indranee and Shanmugam recused themselves from the committee specifically for this case, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong and Parliamentary Secretary for Communications and Information and Health Rahayu Mahzam were nominated to the committee by Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin. Later on, Senior Minister of State for Defence and Manpower Zaqy Mohamad was appointed to replace Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli, who recused himself too.\n\nThe following day, the Workers' Party approved the formation of a disciplinary panel separate from the Committee of Privileges to look into Raeesah's conduct, chaired by Pritam Singh, Sylvia Lim and Faisal Manap.\n\nResignation\n\nOn 30 November 2021, Raeesah submitted her resignation from the Workers' Party and Parliament following the probe over her admission of lying. Raeesah also posted on her social media accounts her letter of resignation addressed to Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin. Despite the resignation, the Committee of Privileges announced it will continue its investigations.\n\nTwo days later, the Workers' Party Central Executive Committee said they knew about the lies the week after her speech, but they decided to let her set the record straight after knowing her circumstances, with Workers' Party Secretary-General Pritam Singh asking Raeesah to make her best efforts in contacting the victim or the individuals involved in that sexual assault case. The matter was supposed to have been clarified in Parliament in September, but a shingles episode made that unlikely. When Raeesah returned to Parliament in October, she repeated her assertions instead of clarifying. Furthermore, the Party leaders voted overwhelmingly to ask Raeesah to resign even before she did so, with expulsion if she did not resign. Instead, Raeesah informed Pritam she would resign, before the Central Executive Committee met on the matter. In addition, the MPs of Sengkang GRC will not step down for a by-election, with the responsibilities of Compassvale divided accordingly. Workers' Party Vice-Chairperson and Aljunied GRC MP Faisal Manap will also act as an advisor to the Sengkang MPs. Additional support will be given for the Sengkang team during house visits, which will resume in January. The Workers' Party will review how candidates are selected for elections as well as vetting of speeches, even as it is not deterred from fielding young and progressive candidates in future elections. Before the speech was made, Raeesah was told to substantiate the anecdote, which was eventually not heeded. Separately, on former Non-constituency Member of Parliament Daniel Goh's comments, the Party said it would look into them, given that cadres do not share opinions openly, to which Goh said he had every right as a citizen to comment. Goh was subsequently expelled from the party in 2023 due to his comments.\n\nInvestigations by the Committee of Privileges\nAfter investigations, on 10 February 2022, the Committee of Privileges recommended that Raeesah be fined S$35,000, with Pritam Singh and Muhamad Faisal bin Abdul Manap being referred to the Public Prosecutor for prosecution. A parliamentary debate was held on 15 February, with the recommendations accepted. Subsequently on 29 April, the case was referred to the Police so that they can interview further witnesses who are related to this case.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Raeesah Khan on Parliament of Singapore\n Workers' Party biography\n\n1993 births\nLiving people\nWorkers' Party (Singapore) politicians\nSingaporean people of Arab descent\nMurdoch University alumni\nPeople from Singapore\nSingaporean people of Indian descent\nSingaporean people of Malay descent\nSingaporean people of Pakistani descent\nSingaporean women in politics\nMembers of the Parliament of Singapore\nSingaporean politicians of Indian descent"}

{"eng_Latn":"The Guan Yu Statue was a large monument to Chinese deified military general Guan Yu that was formerly located in Jingzhou, China. The statue was designed by Han Meilin, and finished construction in 2016. It stands at 58 metres tall, weighs 1,197 tonnes, and is made of around 4,000 bronze strips. The project began in 2013 when Han Meilin visited Jingzhou for inspiration, and personally oversaw the designing and installing of the statue.\n\nGuan Yu was depicted wearing his traditional robes and cloak, whilst wielding his famous guandao known as the Green Dragon Crescent Blade, which weighs 123 tonnes. The figure stood atop a 10 metre pedestal, which resembles an ancient Chinese warship. Inside the base is a 7,710 square-metre museum and shrine to Guan Yu. \n\nThe project cost 1.5 billion yuan, and was officially opened to the public on June 17, 2016. On the day of the unveiling, activities such as worship, visiting fairs, and praying to Guan Yu were held. Han Meilin was present for the ceremony.\n\nBackground \nGuan Yu was a Chinese military general serving under the warlord Liu Bei during the late Eastern Han dynasty. His life was lionised and his achievements glorified to such an extent after his death in 220 that he was deified during the Sui dynasty. Through generations of story telling, culminating in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, his deeds and moral qualities have been given immense emphasis, making Guan Yu one of East Asia's most popular paradigms of loyalty and righteousness. He is still worshipped today as a bodhisattva in Buddhist tradition and as a guardian deity in Chinese folk religion and Taoism. He is also held in high esteem in Confucianism.\n\nRelocation \nIn September 2020, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development criticized the Guan Yu statue as \"vain and wasteful\", and that its towering presence in the skyline \"ruined the character and culture of Jingzhou as a historic city\" and called for rectification. An investigation by the state broadcaster China Central Television revealed that the project's developers only had permission to build the pedestal of the statue (the museum). The developers, treating the statue as a piece of art, claimed to be unaware that large statues required their own planning processes, nor were they aware that the statue's current location had a height limit of 15m. Additionally, land under the statue started to sink under its weight.\n\nIn response to the central government order, Jingzhou city officials announced in October that the statue will be relocated. The new location of the statue will be 8 km away in Dianjiangtai, where Guan Yu was said to have drilled his troops. The cost of the relocation is estimated at 155 million yuan.\n\nDemolition of the statue began in September 2021 and was complete by the first half of 2022. The museum closed its door to the public and has no plans of reopening in the short-term. Construction of the statue at the new site has yet to begin as of April 2023.\n\nReferences \n\n2016 sculptures\nBronze sculptures in China\nSculptures of gods\nJingzhou\nGuan Yu\nColossal statues in China\n2016 establishments in China\nBuildings and structures in Hubei"}
{"eng_Latn":"William Edward Miller (February 5, 1836December 10, 1919) was an American soldier and Pennsylvania State Senator who fought with the Union Army in the American Civil War. Miller received his country's highest award for bravery during combat, the Medal of Honor, for actions taken on July 3, 1863, during the Battle of Gettysburg. While ordered to keep his company stationed on a hill, he disobeyed these orders to lead a surprise attack against a Confederate charge. Said to have saved Gettysburg for his decision to break rank, this was claimed to be the first time in American military history where a soldier was awarded for disobeying a direct order.\n\nEarly life\nWilliam Edward Miller was born to Andrew and Eleanor (n\u00e9e Umberger) in West Hill, Pennsylvania, one mile west of Plainfield, on February 5, 1836. As the oldest son, William helped his father run the family farm and care for his five younger siblings. He received a limited education in the local school system and at 16 joined a local cavalry militia, the \"Big Spring Adamantite Guard\".\n\nCivil War service\nAt the onset of the American Civil War, Miller's cavalry unit was one of the first militia to offer their services to Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin. Miller was mustered into the Union Army as a second lieutenant on August 8, 1861, for a three-year enlistment, and the unit was given the designation Company H of the 3rd Pennsylvania Cavalry. Because Miller had served with the militia for nine years preceding the war, he was one of the few guards who kept his former rank. After cavalry training at Camp Marcey near Washington, D.C., Miller was one of the few officers who retained his commission.\n\nMiller first saw service in 1862 during the Peninsula campaign. After fighting in skirmishes around Yorktown, Virginia, the 3rd Pennsylvania was relocated to Williamsburg. Once in Williamsburg, Miller was ordered by Brigadier General Samuel P. Heintzelman to deliver a message to Major General George B. McClellan back at Yorktown. After successfully completing his orders he received commendations from both generals. During this campaign, Miller met with Prince Philippe, the Count of Paris, who was serving as assistant adjutant general to McClellan with the rank of captain. The two maintained a friendship following the war.\n\nIn September 1862, the 3rd Pennsylvania was sent to Maryland to defend against the invasion force of Robert E. Lee. On September 16, the regiment helped lead Brigadier General Joseph Hooker's corps across Antietam Creek and Company H was assigned to Hooker's headquarters. The following afternoon, as Confederate Lieutenant General Stonewall Jackson was pushing towards the Union line, one of his brigades rushed forward on a Union gun battery. Miller came to the aid of the battery and helped rescue guns before they fell to the enemy, and for his gallantry was promoted to captain for his efforts and bravery. With his promotion to captain, Miller became the commander of Company H.\n\nGettysburg\n\nOn July 2, 1863, the 3rd Pennsylvania Cavalry arrived at Brinkerhoff's Ridge to the east of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Miller's company, totaling roughly 100 troops, assumed a position on the right flank of the Union line near Cress Run which they held for the rest of the day. In the evening, Miller's Company H pushed forward with Company M to slow the advance of the 2nd Virginia Cavalry along the ridge. This prevented the Confederate army from fully fortifying the later attack on Culp's Hill as it would have left their flank uncovered.\n\nOn July 3, Miller was given orders to hold his company \"at all hazards\" in the woods north of the Lott house and assist the 1st New Jersey Cavalry Regiment in repelling Brigadier General Wade Hampton's advance. When the enemy brigade advanced, Miller noticed a large contingent led by Confederate Brigadier General Fitzhugh Lee threatening to break through a main section of the Union line. From his flank position he decided to disobey his orders and attack the Confederate from the side and stated to his adjutants, \"I have been ordered to hold this position, but, if you will back me up in case I am court-martialed for disobedience, I will order a charge.\" With full company agreement, Miller led his men into the flank of the Confederate advance causing confusion among the rebels who believed their retreat path was about to be cut off. Because of Miller's surprise attack, the Confederate rear line was dispersed, and the Union line saved. During the melee, Miller was shot through the right arm. After the fighting, Colonel John Baillie McIntosh, who had attacked the Confederate charge from the opposite flank, congratulated Miller on his attack.\n\nLate Civil War service\nMiller fought with the Union army for another year before being mustered out of service on August 24, 1864. Despite disobeying a direct order he was never court-martialed for his decision to break rank. Indeed, his decision to charge the Confederate advance earned him the Medal of Honor, which was awarded in July 1897. It was stated at the time that Miller's action was the first and only instance in which a US soldier was awarded for disobeying a direct order. Later reports credited Miller's decision as one of the turning points of the Battle of Gettysburg, with one reporter even calling him the man who \"won Gettysburg\".\n\nIn a 1906 work by Arthur L. Wagner on military tactics, Wagner contrasted Miller's surprise attack with Lord Cardigan's Charge of the Light Brigade in the Battle of Balaclava. Whereas Cardigan's inaction to attack an exposed flank of the Russian cavalry caused his own brigade to lose the battle, Miller's disobedience served as the catalyst to end the Confederate approach and save the day.\n\nAfter he was mustered out of service, Miller was elected a companion of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.\n\nMedal of Honor citation\n\nPersonal life\nOn October 23, 1856, Miller married Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Ann Hocker. Together they had two children, Caroline and Elizabeth (Lizzie). Betsy died of typhoid in 1859 at the age of 24 before the Civil War began. His daughter Lizzie died in 1862 during the war.\n\nIn 1868, following the Civil War, Miller married for a second time, to Anna Depui Bush. Together they moved to Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where Miller began a hardware business on North Hanover Street, which he continued in until 1898. Miller was active in local politics, and served as the Chair of the Democratic committee in 1877 and 1888, and Burgess of Carlisle in 1882 and 1883. In 1894 his wife Anna died and Miller never remarried. That same year, he served as the president of the Carlisle Board of Health, a position he held for four years. In 1898 he was elected to the Pennsylvania State Senate as a Democrat, serving from 1899 to 1902. Following his stint in the State Senate, Miller sold fire insurance.\n\nMiller was also an active force in creating the Hamilton Library Association, which was the forerunner to the Cumberland County Historical Society. To this organization he donated many artifacts from the Civil War, and served as secretary of its library until 1918.\n\nMiller died on December 10, 1919, and is buried at Gettysburg National Cemetery.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nDocumentary on Miller by the Cumberland County Historical Society\n\n1836 births\n1919 deaths\nAmerican Civil War recipients of the Medal of Honor\nBusinesspeople from Pennsylvania\nPeople from Carlisle, Pennsylvania\nPeople from Cumberland County, Pennsylvania\nPeople of Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\nUnited States Army Medal of Honor recipients\nDemocratic Party Pennsylvania state senators\nBurials at Gettysburg National Cemetery\n19th-century American businesspeople"}
{"eng_Latn":"Diana Guerrero-Maci\u00e1 (born 1966) is an American studio-based artist who has produced paintings, works on paper, prints and sculpture. She is known for her hybrid or \"unpainted paintings\"\u2014works constructed with fabric cutwork, collage, stitching and dye that collapse boundaries between the fields of painting, fiber and design and challenge distinctions between \"high\" art and craft. Her largely abstract work samples and revises multiple materials, symbols and typography, and graphic elements such as grids, stripes and archetypal shapes to engage with color, iconography and diverse cultural movements and conventions. \n\nGuerrero-Maci\u00e1 has exhibited in solo shows at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (MCA), Artpace and South Bend Museum of Art, and group exhibitions at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, Crocker Art Museum and John Michael Kohler Arts Center (JMKAC), among others. In 2021, she received a Guggenheim Fellowship, following earlier awards from organizations including the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation and MacDowell. Her work belongs to the permanent collections of the Crocker Museum, Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art, and South Bend Museum of Art. Guerrero-Maci\u00e1 is a professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nBiography\nGuerrero-Maci\u00e1 was born in 1966 in Cleveland, Ohio to Cuban immigrant parents. Her mother was a Spanish literature professor and quilter and her father an industrial design engineer and inventor. She earned a BFA from Villanova University in 1988, then spent a year working on social justice issues in the San Francisco area with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps. In 1990, she enrolled in graduate studies at Cranbrook Academy of Art, where her work shifted from largely narrative, figural painting to non-traditional work involving textiles, craft-based processes, collage and appropriation, and the influence of lyrical poetry. After receiving an MFA from Cranbrook in 1992, she was awarded a residency at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, where she developed relationships with other artists that encouraged her move to Chicago later that year.\n\nGuerrero-Maci\u00e1 had early solo shows at Artemisia Gallery and Contemporary Art Workshop in Chicago and Forum for Contemporary Art in St. Louis. In 2001, she joined the faculty of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) after teaching at School of Art at Washington University in St. Louis (now the Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts) from 1997 to 2001. She has taught in the Fiber & Material Studies and Painting & Drawing departments at SAIC, serving as chair of the former from 2016 to 2019.\n\nWork and reception\nCritics situate Guerrero-Maci\u00e1's work at the intersection of painting, fiber, design and conceptual art traditions, noting its blurring of such boundaries and refusal of binaries such as \"high\" modernism or craft, formal severity or kitsch playfulness, geometric, hard-edged or biomorphic, pliable forms, the metaphysical or quotidian. She works in two- and three-dimensional media, with a long history of hybrid techniques including collage, assemblage, sewing and dyeing, sampling and appropriation inspired by the work of artists such as Robert Rauschenberg and the Pattern and Decoration movement.\n\nHer hybrid paintings\u2014encompassing hand-sewn textile and paper collages and reclaimed objects and clothing\u2014employ a patchwork aesthetic in two ways: formally, using textiles like paint, as a vehicle for color, texture and depth; and as a method to sample styles, graphics, symbols of identity, histories and lived experiences. The resulting vocabulary engages themes involving visual and verbal language, the gendering of art genres, ethnicity and race, the body and social issues, often adopting historical iconography (e.g., medieval millefleur tapestries, 20th century radical movements such as Russian Suprematism, 1960s counterculture and punk rock) informed by contemporary social currents. West Coast critic DeWitt Cheng wrote that Diana Guerrero-Maci\u00e1 wove together variegated cultural threads\u2014revalidated decorative \"women's art,\" text and word-based art, digital-age cross-pollination\u2014into \"samplers born of sampling, metaphors for wandering streams of consciousness, yet also satisfying artifacts.\"\n\nEarlier work \nIn exhibitions at the MCA Chicago (2003), Artpace (2005) and Bodybuilder & Sportsman Gallery (2003, 2006), Guerrero-Maci\u00e1 presented text-based, hand-sewn textile works and collages that reviews compared to ransom notes, commercial signage and the work of artists Ed Ruscha and Jenny Holzer. Made up largely of words with differently stitched, colored and shaped letter forms, they quoted films, songs and literature, newspaper headlines and colloquial speech\u2014often statements involving love and war\u2014in challenging arrangements that used odd word mash-ups or breaks to alter meanings. Chicago Tribune critic Alan Artner wrote that the fiber medium and its stitched technique created a \"mildly startling\" sense of strangeness unachievable in painting and at odds with the vaguely familiar sentiments being reproduced.\n\nIn her show \"Devoured by Symbols\" (Tony Wight, 2008), Guerrero-Maci\u00e1 recontextualized incongruous, familiar or banal mediated text and, increasingly, imagery in stitched, multi-textile works that playfully reworked painting conventions invoking the sublime: landscape, portrait, narrative, abstraction (e.g., The Tempest, Like a Rainbow). In the large-scale work, The Bigger Picture, she operated like a concrete poet, creating a visual mountain out of the letters that comprise the word \"mountains.\" New City described the show as a \"convergence of typography \u2026 feel-good imagery, fuzzy materiality and tragically romantic quotations\" that evoked contemporary political anxiety and a sense of \"good wishes unfulfilled.\"\n\nLater work \nIn the 2010s, in exhibitions at Traywick Contemporary (Berkeley), the South Bend Museum of Art and Carrie Secrist (Chicago), among others, Guerrero-Maci\u00e1 gradually shifted emphasis from text toward borrowed symbols and archetypal forms that she cut, dyed and stitched into bold, geometric compositions. Like her text pieces, these works connected ubiquitous icons\u2014in this case, smiley faces, rainbows, targets, butterflies, hearts\u2014with art historical references through graphic schemes, using diagrams or charts to reinvigorate their meanings and pose questions through cryptic personal and cultural references (e.g., her \"Slow Blossoming\" works, 2016). Among those meanings were messages embedded within the work's laborious, deliberately analog, handmade processes and tactile materials, related to gender and sexual equality, environmental and military concerns, cosmic speculation, and art\/craft hierarchies,.\n\nGuerrero-Maci\u00e1's show \"Siblings of the Sun\" (2015) explored the theory that unknown universes were created by the Big Bang, its centerpiece an array of fifty small collages featuring bright color and simple geometric forms that DeWitt Cheng described as \"an apt metaphor for the current art cosmos: pluralistic, hybrid, and buzzing with free-floating contradictions.\" Her \"The Beautiful Girls\" (2018) edition of prints presented diverse representations of gender and ethnicity through the visual motif of eyes, inspired by Hannah H\u00f6ch\u2019s Ethnographic Museum photomontages of the 1920s. In the show \"The Devil's Daughter is Getting Married\" (Secrist, 2020) and works such as Always the Sun (An Intersectional Sunrise) (JMKAC, \"High Touch\" exhibition, 2021), Guerrero-Maci\u00e1 presented paper collages and monumental gridded fields of cut cloth ornamented with three-dimensional props and familiar graphic motifs, which explored the visual pleasure of decoration, as well as subtle narratives about the ambitions of modernist abstraction, needlework and feminism, myth and her Cuban upbringing.\n\nRecognition\nGuerrero-Maci\u00e1 has received fellowship from the John S. Guggenheim Foundation (2021), Illinois Arts Council (2019) and MacDowell (2022, 2004, 1998) and an award from the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation (2001). She has been awarded public art commissions from the Public Art Fund in New York and the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs. Her work has been acquired by the public art collections of corporations, universities and museums including the Crocker Art Museum, Davis Museum at Wellesley College, Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art and South Bend Museum of Art.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDiana Guerrero-Maci\u00e1 official website \nDiana Guerrero-Maci\u00e1, Bad at Sports, Episode 772, 2021\nDiana Guerrero-Maci\u00e1 and art historian Lisa Wainwright in conversation, 2020\nInterview-With-Diana Guerrero- Maci\u00e1, This Moment Here, 2020\n\nSchool of the Art Institute of Chicago faculty\nCranbrook Academy of Art alumni\nSkowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture alumni\nMacDowell Colony fellows\nAmerican people of Cuban descent\nVillanova University alumni\nHispanic and Latino American artists\n21st-century American women artists\nWomen textile artists\n1966 births\nLiving people\nAmerican women academics\nWashington University in St. Louis faculty\nPenland School of Crafts alumni"}
{"eng_Latn":"Sizewell C nuclear power station is a project to construct a 3,200MWe nuclear power station with two EPR reactors in Suffolk, England. The project was proposed by a consortium of EDF Energy and China General Nuclear Power Group, which own 80% and 20% of the project respectively. In 2022, UK Government announced a buy-out to allow for the exit of CGN from the project and forming a 50% stake with EDF, though EDF expect this to fall below 20% following anticipated external investment. The power station is expected to meet up to 7% of the UK's demand if it comes into service.\n\nThe project is expected to commence before 2024, with construction taking between nine and twelve years, depending on developments at the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, which is also being developed by EDF Energy and which shares major similarities with the Sizewell plant.\n\nHistory\nIn 2008, the government decided that new nuclear sites should be constructed on existing sites to replace the UK's ageing fleet of reactors. In 2010 the government revealed that the Sizewell power station site was one of the eight locations at which it intended to allow the development to occur. Following this, EDF Energy put forward proposals for the Sizewell site in November 2012, where it planned to construct two EPR reactors.\n\nIn 2015, as a part of the government's strategy to open the UK up to China, it was reported that after talks with China agreements had been made to develop three nuclear power plants including Sizewell C, Hinkley Point C and Bradwell B; however, agreements had not yet been made over financing the Sizewell project, with the final agreement likely to be made after the construction of Hinkley Point C had started.\n\nOn 21 October 2015, EDF Energy announced that it had 'agreed the Heads of Terms of a wider UK partnership for the joint development of new nuclear power stations at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex' with China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN). At the same time, EDF Energy also announced that it 'will take an 80% share and CGN will take a 20% share' during the development phase of the project.\n\nFollowing extensive consultation with the local community, on 27 May 2020 EDF Energy announced that it had submitted a development consent order application. EDF stated that 25,000 job opportunities would be created and targeted 70% of the investment to be spent in UK. The plant would largely replicate the Hinkley Point C design to reuse experience and attempt to lower costs.\n\nIn June 2020, EDF had yet to organise financing, and could not take on more construction risk in the UK. EDF was looking to the UK government to assist with financing either by offering a Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model used on less risky infrastructure, though that puts an immediate cost burden on end consumers, or with other approaches such as a government equity stake in the development.\n\nOn 30 June 2020, EDF Energy announced that it had applied to the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) for a licence to build and operate Sizewell C. The ONR is responsible for the safe operation of nuclear sites in the UK and for permitting new nuclear site licencesone of the key regulatory requirements for building and operating a new power station.\n\nOn 11 September 2020, Suffolk county council said that it could not support the plans for the construction of Sizewell C in its current form, with the council saying on 23 October 2020 that the plans \"do not go far enough\" to mitigate the impact on the local community and on the local environment. The council said that a lack of support for the project was not the issue, and that it is that EDF \"simply does not appropriately and sensitively address the impacts on our communities and the environment\". EDF responded by submitting significant changes to the project which aimed to significantly reduce the number of Heavy Goods Vehicles delivering the materials required for the project by having them delivered by train and sea instead. The plans also proposed to increase the amount of land for the creation of fen meadow to help increase the net gain of biodiversity following the completion of the project. A consultation period began on 16 November 2020, which lasted for 30 days and which will inform all of the stakeholders in the project about the proposals.\n\nOn 31 October 2020, the BBC claimed that the government was 'close' to giving the project the green light following intensified talks with EDF, with government officials insisting that it \"remains committed to new nuclear\" following the withdrawal of Horizon from Wylfa and Oldbury. The BBC also reported that the government had increased its interest in taking a stake in the project following work on the second reactor at Hinkley Point C being completed 30% faster than the first reactor, which 'is thought to have substantially mitigated' the risk in taking a stake in the project.\n\nOn 14 December 2020, the UK government published an energy white paper setting out its plans to \"transition to net zero\", and announced the start of negotiations with EDF, with a view to starting investment on \"at least one\" new power station before the end of the current parliament in 2024. CGN is thought to be planning to withdraw from the project.\n\nOn 20 July 2022, the planning application was approved and a Development Consent Order was issued by the Secretary of State. \n\nOn 3 November 2022, the plant was placed under review in the government's effort to cut spending. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt confirmed on 17 November 2022 that construction would go ahead, with initial contracts to be signed \"within weeks\". Security concerns about China caused the government to buy CGN out of the development for just over \u00a3100 million in late 2022, leaving it co-owned by EDF and the UK government.\n\nTimeline\n\nConstruction\nThe Sizewell C project is expected to take between nine and twelve years to construct and commission. EDF expects significant time and cost savings compared to the near-identical sister plant, Hinkley Point C. The projected construction cost of \u00a320billion for Sizewell C when the application for a nuclear site licence was submitted in 2020 is 25% higher than the \u00a316billion that were projected for Hinkley Point C at a similar stage of the planning process in 2012, raising doubts about EDF's claim.\n\nFinancing\nThe Sizewell C project is expected to cost \u00a320billion to \u00a330billion. The project is being led by EDF Energy and CGN, which own 80% and 20% of the project, respectively.\n\nEDF is looking to the UK government to assist with financing either by offering a Regulated Asset Base model, though that puts an immediate cost burden on end consumers, or with other approaches such as a government equity stake in the development, as the company is unwilling to take on further risk within the UK. On 30 June 2020, EDF announced that it had applied to the Office for Nuclear Regulation for a licence to build and operate Sizewell C.\n\nOn 14 July 2020, 32 companies and organisations from the UK nuclear supply chain formed a consortium to encourage the government to support the state-guaranteed financing model for Sizewell C, Regulated Asset Base, which the consortium says would reduce the cost of new nuclear projects by having consumers pay the cost upfront through their energy bills.\n\nOn 30 September 2020, Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy, EDF's chairman and CEO, demanded that the Treasury provided clarity on the future of nuclear funding following Hitachi's withdrawal from the Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station project which was set to cost \u00a320billion, citing a lack of viable funding.\n\nOn 14 December 2020, following the release of the UK government's long-awaited energy white paper, the government announced that it had started consultations with EDF to take a stake in the project following concerns that CGN is backing out of the project, which would leave a financing gap. The government also warned that any stake in the project would be 'subject to approval on areas such as value for money and affordability' with the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Alok Sharma, saying, \"We are starting negotiations with EDF, it is not a green light on the construction\".\n\nIn January 2022, the UK government invested \u00a3100million towards continued development of the project. In March 2022, it was announced that the UK government and EDF would each take a 20% stake in the project, with infrastructure investors and pension funds expected to take up the remaining 60%. Funding was also agreed to improve local activities, courtesy of the Sizewell C and the East Anglia Array projects.\n\nIn August 2022, The Guardian reported expected costs were \u00a320billion to be paid with \u00a31.7billion of taxpayer money and a surcharge on customer energy bills through the Regulated Asset Base model. Barclays had been hired to find new financial backing.\n\nIn November 2022, the UK government announced that it was taking over a 50% stake in the project for \u00a3679million.\nIn February 2023, EDF confirmed that following anticipated external investment its shareholding in the project will be no more than 19.9%. Project costs estimates vary from \u00a320 billion to \u00a335 billion.\n\nIn September 2023, the UK government issued a  pre-qualification questionnaire to prospective investors; successful applicants will be invited to participate in the bidding process. The government have made an additional \u00a3511 million available for project development and site preparation ahead of the bidding process.\n\nCriticism and opposition\n\nOpposition groups\n\nGroups that opposed the construction of the plant include Together Against Sizewell C (TASC) and Stop Sizewell C.\n\nTASC sought a judicial review of the East Suffolk Council's decision to grant planning permission in September 2019 for preparatory works on the site, which would involve the felling of 229 trees as well as the demolition of buildings on the Sizewell B site. The group claimed that the decision was unlawful and that proper investigations into the potential scale of environmental damage had not occurred. The bid to block the works was brought to the High Court on behalf of TASC by a local resident and former Labour Suffolk county councillor, Joan Girling. The court heard the case on 8 September 2020, and ruled that the habitat loss would be \"minor\" and \"not significant\". Mr Justice Holgate rejected the attempt to block the works, and said that he \"did not accept East Suffolk Council acted irrationally\". An EDF spokesperson responded to the rulings by saying that \"The judge acknowledged the robust nature of the report provided by East Suffolk Council regarding the environmental impact of the work. The report, which was informed by the council arboriculturist, found that the majority (73%) of the 229 trees that need to be removed from Coronation Wood are low quality plantation wood with a limited life expectancy and limited amenity value. It was judged that this loss would be 'balanced' by the planting of over 2,500 juvenile woodland trees, including a mixture of broadleaf and coniferous species appropriate for the prevailing soil and coastal conditions.\"\n\nOn 6 October 2020, TASC and the Stop Sizewell C group delivered a petition with over 10,400 signatures to Downing Street, the Treasury and the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, calling for the government to stop Sizewell C as the plans would be costly, risky and would not positively contribute to net zero until 2040.\n\nStop Sizewell C is the campaign name of Theberton and Eastbridge Action Group (TEAGS). TEAGS was formed in 2013 by representatives of the Suffolk parish of Theberton and Eastbridge, which neighbours the proposed Sizewell C construction site, in order to give a voice to the community. TEAGS did not initially oppose Sizewell C, but after eight years of engagement with EDF and other stakeholders, the group changed its name to Stop Sizewell C.\n\nConcerns regarding Chinese involvement\nConcerns have been expressed regarding one of the shareholders in the consortium, CGN, which is owned by the Chinese government and has been blacklisted by the United States Department of Commerce for attempting to acquire advanced U.S. nuclear technology and material for diversion to military use.\nIn September 2020, following Hitachi's decision to withdraw from the Wylfa and Oldbury projects, the BBC reported that the UK government was looking to replace CGN as an investor and might take a stake in Sizewell C.\n\nConcerns regarding water consumption\nSome environmental campaigners and Sizewell critics have questioned if it will be possible to meet the plant's need for potable water without adversely impacting the supplies available to surrounding areas. Figures released in early 2010 by the Sizewell A and B operators\u2014Magnox Ltd and EDF, respectively\u2014indicated that the two existing plants were consuming approximately  of mains water each day, in addition to the  of seawater that the operators are permitted to use for cooling systems that do not require treated water. Critics estimated that Sizewell C would require a further  of potable water daily, and suggested that EDF were planning to use the mains supply because it would be cheaper than the alternative of establishing a desalination plant. Essex and Suffolk Water, the mains-water supplier for the area, stated in response that they were satisfied that the water supply would be \"sustainable\" for the next 25 years even if Sizewell C were to be built.\n\nHowever, Essex and Suffolk Water later reversed its position, leading EDF to plan instead on using a temporary desalination plant to provide for construction water needs while also building a permanent  pipeline from the River Waveney to the Sizewell C sitebut this plan was also halted when in August 2021 Essex and Suffolk Water informed EDF that the Environment Agency would be curtailing their licences to abstract water from the River Waveney by up to 60%. The water company subsequently confirmed that \"existing water resources (including the River Waveney) will not be sufficient to meet forecast mains water demand, including the operational demand of Sizewell C,\" leading EDF to declare that it would rely on a permanent desalination system supplying the plant's needs if no other solution could be found. This was accepted by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Kwasi Kwarteng, who held that \"the uncertainty over the permanent water supply strategy is not a barrier to granting consent\" to the Sizewell C project.\n\nOn 8 August 2022, Together Against Sizewell C (TASC), supported by Friends of the Earth, announced its intention to contest the development consent order, based primarily on the failure to first secure a water supply. In its earlier rejection of the scheme, the Planning Inspectorate had stated that \"unless the outstanding water supply strategy can be resolved and sufficient information provided to enable the secretary of state to carry out his obligations under the Habitats Regulations, the case for an order granting development consent for the application is not made out\".\n\nPreference for other energy sources\n\nResearchers such as Professor Barrett et al at UCL claim, based on detailed cost studies, that a judicious mix of renewable energy, storage, hydrogen, and fossil fuel offers the same constant availability of power as Sizewell C, at lower cost.\n\nSee also\n\n Nuclear power in the United Kingdom\n Energy policy of the United Kingdom\n Energy in the United Kingdom\n List of nuclear reactors#United Kingdom\n Proposed nuclear power stations in the United Kingdom\n Hinkley Point C nuclear power station\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Sizewell C planning documentation on National Infrastructure Planning website.\n\nBuildings and structures in Suffolk\nProposed nuclear power stations in the United Kingdom\nNuclear power stations using EPR reactors\nProposed power stations in England\n\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France\nNationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (United Kingdom)"}

{"eng_Latn":"Katherine (Kay) MacDonald (1931 \u2013 31 August 2018) was a Canadian religious figure who, at the time of her appointment as president of the International Union of Superiors General, was the highest ranking woman in the Catholic Church. Her career started at a small Catholic Academy in Saskatchewan, Canada and led her to a variety of senior positions across Canada, in Rome, and in Israel. MacDonald focused her career on fighting antisemitism in the Catholic Church and improving relationships between Christian and Jewish populations. MacDonald's life and career has been documented by the National Film Board of Canada in a 2000 documentary co-production between the NFB and Four Square Productions Canada Ltd.\n\nEarly life\nMacDonald was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in 1931 as the daughter of two rural school teachers from Prince Edward Island. She was the youngest child of her family and had four brothers: Ron, Jack, Cyril, and Bob. Her brother Cyril MacDonald was a political figure in Saskatchewan. MacDonald attended St. Joseph's Elementary School as a child and Sion Academy for high school.\n\nReligious career\n\nEarly years\nOn graduating high school, MacDonald spent two years in the novitiate of the Sisters of Sion before going to university. MacDonald earned a B.A. and B.Ed. in English and history from the University of Saskatchewan, an M.A. from St. Louis University, and spent time at Fordham University studying theology. On finishing her education, MacDonald worked as a teacher and principal at both Sion Academy and Austin O'Brien Catholic High School.\n\nFocus on antisemitism\nUp until this point in MacDonald's career, she felt she was serving God through education. Her experiences in Rome during the Second Vatican Council caused her to realize the antisemitism of the Catholic Church; specifically the role of Christianity in the Holocaust and learning about her orders history of forced conversions of Jewish children to Christianity. MacDonald decided to dedicate the rest of her career to attempting to combat discrimination between religious groups. Her first larger opportunity to enact this change came in 1970, when she was elected to the General Council of Congregations. After 5 years on the Council, MacDonald was elected Superior General of her order. MacDonald held this post from 1975 until 1986.\n\nMacDonald's involvement with antisemitism led her to work with the International Council Of Christians and Jews, be elected as the president of the International Union of Superiors General (1983-1986), be appointed the associate director of the Canadian Centre for Ecumenism, and be the provincial leader for the Sisters of Sion in Jerusalem (1990-1996). It was during her time with the Canadian Centre for Ecumenism that she expanded her work from improving relations between Christians and Jews to also include Muslims.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of MacDonald's work was rewriting her orders constitution to no longer push members to convert Jews to Catholicism and to instead recognize Judaism as a valid path to God. These changes were initially rejected by the Vatican. After 4 years of fighting, it was eventually accepted. Later in MacDonald's career, she expanded this belief to include all religions instead of just Judaism.\n\nUnder MacDonald's leadership, the Sisters of Sion instituted progressive new policies including: the habit was no longer mandatory garb; the Sisters of Sion\u2018s constitution was changed to no longer aim to convert Jews to Catholicism and all religions were recognised as valid paths to God and salvation.\n\nAwards\n Inter-faith Leadership Award by the North American Council of Christian and Jews \n Order of National Merit by the President of France \n 2008 Distinguished Alumna Award from St. Thomas More College at University of Saskatchewan\n\nReferences\n\n1931 births\n2018 deaths\nUniversity of Saskatchewan alumni\nPeople from Saskatoon"}

{"eng_Latn":"John Gurney is a British businessman and former football club chairman. He came to national attention for his eventful 55-day spell as chairman of Luton Town in the summer of 2003, during which time he sacked a manager via post and organised a \"Manager Idol\" phone-in to find a new one, whilst announcing plans for a massive new stadium on stilts, a change of club name, and a potential relocation. He had previously owned non-league clubs Farnborough Town, Southall and Ashford United, and rugby club Bedford. He was arrested and charged with conspiring to import cocaine in February 1999, but acquitted after a trial.\n\n1999 arrest and early sporting ventures\nGurney was one of ten people charged with conspiring to import cocaine in February 1999 following a police raid that uncovered 472\u00a0kg of the drug (valued at \u00a3100\u00a0million) in a lock-up garage in Leigh. The subsequent investigation saw him named as a \"financial associate\" of Brian Brendan Wright, who was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment in April 2007 after running an international cocaine smuggling empire. Gurney was acquitted following a trial in which the prosecution declined to provide any evidence. However Gurney's arrest put a stop to his consortium which was attempting to buy Conference club Farnborough Town. He went on to become involved in Southall, who were suspended from the Isthmian League due to a dispute over the club's ownership structure. He was also reported to have been \"run out of town at Bedford Rugby Club\". He had acquired the Bedford club for \u00a31 from boxing promoter Frank Warren in 1999 and promptly sacked head coach Rudolf Straeuli and cut salaries; he attempted to merge the club with Coventry and move the club to Ashford. Gurney claimed that a man called Doug Braddock had taken control of the company that owned the club, Jefferson Lloyd International, without his knowledge and that it was Braddock who had sacked Straeuli. Gurney attempted to sell the rugby club to Coventry City Football Club, a move which was blocked by the Rugby Football Union, before Bedford residents managed to purchase the club for \u00a3750,000. Yet another non-league football club, Ashford United, were also acquired by Gurney and reportedly left in a financial mess upon his departure.\n\nChairmanship of Luton Town\nOn 20 May 2003, Gurney led a consortium that successfully purchased Luton Town for the price of \u00a34 from owner Mike Watson-Challis, who had been keen to offload the club as it was costing him a reported loss of \u00a3500,000 a month. Gurney claimed to be backed by \"international investors\", whose identities he never revealed. Within three days Gurney had sacked Luton manager Joe Kinnear and his assistant, Mick Harford; he had informed the popular duo of their dismissal via post. He blamed chief executive Peter Miller for the sacking, claiming that \"on a brief visit to this club from Northampton Town [Miller was also Northampton Town's commercial manager] took it upon himself to dismiss the club\u2019s manager and assistant manager\". He also banned local newspaper Luton on Sunday, whose editor Aylia Fox said that \"Gurney does not like us because we first broke the takeover story and have been the only paper since that has been telling it how it is.... [this is] straight from the you-couldn\u2019t-make-it-up-if-you-tried department\".\n\nHe outlined plans to build a Formula One track around a 70,000-capacity stadium, which would have a removable pitch supported over the top of the M1 motorway on concrete rafters. He claimed the track would net the club \u00a350\u00a0million in profit a year. This new stadium would be shared with NFL and NBA franchises. He also aimed to change the club's name to London-Luton Football Club so as to link the club with a local airport. Upon meeting midfielder Kevin Nicholls he informed the player that he planned to install a one-armed bandit with a \u00a325,000 payout in the dressing room. He allegedly told investors Luton were \"a grotty little club\".\n\nHe also raised the possibility of Luton merging with Wimbledon, a club located over 40 miles away, in order to secure a position in the league above. This idea had more of a grounding in reality as the move had come close to happening in 1983, when protests by supporters thwarted then-chairman Denis Mortimer's proposal. In 2004, Wimbledon controversially relocated to Milton Keynes to become the Milton Keynes Dons. The speculation damaged Gurney's credibility at Luton, with The Guardian reporting that \"Gurney's naivety in talking publicly about such an unlikely scheme is alarming\".\n\nGurney had intended to appoint Terry Fenwick as manager, but fan opposition led him to reconsider.  Former Peterborough United chairman Roger Terrell and player Lee Power were set to be named as chairman and vice-chairman, but quit after fans threw fruit at them upon their arrival at Kenilworth Road. He then created a phone-vote to appoint the club's new manager, charging 50p per call to a premium landline, saying that he didn't like \"being seen to give way to the mob so we\u2019ve come up with the idea of Manager Idol based on Pop Idol\"; he gave a list of eight candidates for fans to vote on: Fenwick, Kinnear, Nigel Clough, Steve Cotterill, Mike Newell, Stuart Pearce, Gardner Speirs and Gu\u00f0j\u00f3n \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson. An initial vote eliminated five candidates and left just Kinnear, Newell and Cotterill. On 23 June, he announced the winner of \"Manager Idol\" to be Mike Newell, though it was reported that Kinnear had received 82% of the votes but refused to rejoin the club due to Gurney's involvement and Cotterill had also publicly ruled himself out. Gurney admitted \"there\u2019s all sorts of chaos [because] we failed to agree terms with Joe Kinnear, Steve Cotterill is not here and Mike is. And we said whoever was available and we agreed terms with by 1pm today would be the new manager, so Mike is the new manager\".\n\nThe Luton Town Supporters' Trust was set up in order to wrestle control of the club from Gurney; Trust chairman Liam Day stated that \"if [the situation] wasn't so serious, it would have been hilarious.\" The Trust convinced supporters and local sponsors to boycott season tickets and club sponsorship and instead pledge almost \u00a3300,000 towards the Trust. The club players and staff went unpaid throughout Gurney's tenure. The Football League placed the club under a transfer embargo and withheld television and league sponsorship money due to the ongoing uncertainty over the details of the club's ownership structure, citing \"grave concern\" with the set up after a meeting with Gurney where he refused point blank to provide any information. The Trust then acquired shares in the club's major creditor, Hatters Holdings, an offshore company that was owed several million pounds by the club. Now in control of Hatters Holdings, the Trust then placed the club into administrative receivership (a technically different process to administration) on 14 July 2003 to force out John Gurney after just 55 days in charge despite him warning them that: \"If they expect me to walk away from Luton with nothing, I\u2019ll make very sure there\u2019s nothing to walk away from\". A documentary on BBC Two called Trouble at the Top detailed his tenure, which was shown the following year, and in which he admitted that \"I was the most hated man in football\".\n\nLater life\nGurney was declared bankrupt in April 2008.\n\nReferences\n\nYear of birth unknown\nLiving people\nPeople acquitted of crimes\nEnglish football chairmen and investors\nLuton Town F.C.\nYear of birth missing (living people)"}

National Democratic Alternative (ADN) led by  H\u00e9ctor Bautista and Progressive Vanguard under  H\u00e9ctor Serrano, proposed on the eve of the National Council meeting that the leadership would renew the proposal of the head of government of the capital that fell to Granados Covarrubias.

{"eng_Latn":"\"Crown of Thorns\" is a song by English singer-songwriter Clark Datchler, which was released in 1990 as the lead single from his debut solo studio album Raindance. The song was written by Datchler, and produced by Datchler and Humberto Gatica. \"Crown of Thorns\" peaked at No. 100 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nBackground\nSpeaking of the song's lyrical message, Datchler told Simon Mayo for the Reading Evening Post in 1990: \"It's about the way we no longer respect the roots of religion, especially Christianity, and the way it's become commercialised. What Jesus said actually made sense, but if he was around and died today they'd make posters of him like some football hero. I wanted to point out what was important and say that although it is abused, if you look beneath all the rubbish, [religion] does have a real point and value.\"\n\nThe release of \"Crown of Thorns\" as the lead single from Raindance was the decision of Virgin. In a 2013 interview with Paul Sinclair for Super Deluxe Edition, Datchler said how he felt the song was \"a bit of a heavy subject for a pop single\".\n\nA music video was filmed to promote the single, which features Datchler performing the song, interspersed with effects and scenes relating to the lyrics.\n\nCritical reception\nOn its release, Alex Kadis of Smash Hits wrote, \"It's undoubtedly super and musically accomplished but it's not exactly 'of the moment'. But then, if Michael Bolton can get away with slushy, epic ballads so can Datchler, and anyway, this is far smoother and grander and weepier than anything you'll have heard for a long time.\" Jon Wilde of Melody Maker described the song as a \"blow-dried, bedridden piece of Phil Collinsesque fakery\" and \"the most irritating record\" since Max Bygraves' 1954 hit \"Gilly Gilly Ossenfeffer Katzenellen Bogen by the Sea\".\n\nBob Eborall of the Ealing Leader considered the song \"a tuneful, pleading track\" which \"could score [Datchler a hit]\". Music & Media listed the song as a \"sure hit\" and described it as a \"well-arranged song\" but felt it was \"sadly let down by some awkward lyrics in the verses\". They added: \"Tortured artists do not make great pop music.\"\n\nTrack listing\n7\" single\n\"Crown of Thorns\" - 4:32\n\"Widow\" - 3:40\n\n12\" and CD single\n\"Crown of Thorns\" - 5:07\n\"Widow\" - 3:40\n\"Shattered Dreams\" (Acoustic Version) - 3:25\n\nCD single (UK #2)\n\"Crown of Thorns\" - 5:07\n\"Widow\" - 3:40\n\"Shattered Dreams\" (Acoustic Version) - 3:25\n\"Crown of Thorns\" (Instrumental Version) - 5:07\n\nCD single (Japanese release)\n\"Crown of Thorns\" - 4:32\n\"Shattered Dreams\" (Acoustic Version) - 3:25\n\nPersonnel\nCrown of Thorns\n Clark Datchler - vocals, keyboards\n The Giant - guitar\n Nathan East - bass\n John Robinson - drums\n Simon Franglen, Albert Boekholt - programming\n\nProduction\n Clark Datchler - producer (all tracks)\n Humberto Gatica - producer and engineer on \"Crown of Thorns\"\n Nick Davis - mixing on \"Crown of Thorns\" and \"Widow\", engineer on \"Crown of Thorns\"\n Bob Kraushaar - engineer on \"Crown of Thorns\"\n Chris Blaire - mastering\n\nOther\n Richard Haughton - photography\n Stylorouge - design\n\nCharts\n\nReferences\n\n1990 songs\n1990 singles\nVirgin Records singles\nSongs written by Clark Datchler"}

{"eng_Latn":"Tolkien's Middle-earth family trees contribute to the impression of depth and realism in the stories set in his fantasy world by showing that each character is rooted in history with a rich network of relationships. J. R. R. Tolkien included multiple family trees in both The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion; they are variously for Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, and Men.\n\nThe family trees gave Tolkien, a philologist, a way of exploring and developing the etymologies and relationships of the names of his characters.  They imply, too, the fascination of his Hobbit characters with their family history. A further function was to show how aspects of character derive from ancestry.\n\nGenealogies\n\nThe Lord of the Rings\n\nThe appendices to The Lord of the Rings provide family trees for Dwarves, Hobbits, and Men. The Hobbit trees are introduced with the words \"The names given in these Trees are only a selection from many.\" Their development is chronicled in The Peoples of Middle-earth; it records that the Boffin and Bolger family trees were typed up for inclusion in Appendix C but were dropped at the last moment, apparently for reasons of space.\n\nThe Silmarillion\n\nThe Silmarillion provides family trees for the Elves Finw\u00eb, father of F\u00ebanor, and Olw\u00eb, ancestor of Galadriel and L\u00fathien; the Man B\u00ebor the Old, ancestor of Beren, Hurin, and Turin; and of Hador, ancestor of E\u00e4rendil the mariner. In The Silmarillion, Tolkien described an extraordinarily complex set of family relationships, feuds, and migrations of family subgroups within the various lineages of Elves. The lengthy course of development of all these is detailed by Christopher Tolkien in Unfinished Tales, The Book of Lost Tales II, and The Lays of Beleriand. The family trees and resulting populations have been explored by Tom Loback in Mythlore.\n\nEffects\n\nJason Fisher, in the J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia, writes that Tolkien's family trees serve multiple functions. They define the ancestry of both heroes and villains, along with all their relationships, just as in the medieval Icelandic sagas which Tolkien studied carefully. In this way, Tolkien was placing the Middle-earth sagas in a definite tradition. Secondly, the family trees provide a powerful impression of depth, bringing \"essential details, texture, and verisimilitude\" to his secondary world. In The Two Towers, the Wizard Gandalf jokingly warns Th\u00e9oden, King of Rohan, of the ways of Hobbits with family affairs:\n\nThirdly, the trees allowed him, as a philologist, to develop, explore, and play with the etymologies and relationships of the names of his characters, something that he much enjoyed. Fourthly, the family trees helped to guide him while writing to avoid mistakes in describing relationships. Fifthly, the Hobbit-style genealogies imitate the hobbitic fascination with family history; Tolkien maintained the framing fiction that The Lord of the Rings was, in fact, the Red Book of Westmarch written entirely by Hobbits. Tolkien says as much in the novel's prologue:\n\nYet another function was to show how different ancestries, and hence different aspects of character, come together in some of the characters. Bilbo Baggins, eponymous protagonist of The Hobbit, was born to a genteel Baggins and an adventurous Took, while his cousin (often familiarly described as his nephew) and heir Frodo was the child of a Baggins and a relatively outlandish Brandybuck. \nFinally, the trees mention which Hobbits had children and which did not, thus giving the impression that the story continues after the end of the book, reinforcing the impression of depth.\n\nFisher states that in The Silmarillion, the family trees work the same way, but the tales, told as ancient legends rather than in-the-moment action, are narrated from the points of view of Elves or sometimes of Men (Edain). Here the trees help with a different function, namely to visualise the splitting and mixing of family lines, mirroring the bitter family feuds among The Silmarillions Elves.\n\nConstruction\n\nMalcolm Forbes, reviewing Catherine McIlwaine's exhibition of Tolkien's Middle-earth artefacts at the Bodleian Library, commented that \"his realm of Middle-earth [is] the product of a fecund imagination, fierce intelligence and creative prowess. Few fantasy writers so meticulously map their kingdoms, or invent legends, family trees and even languages for their characters.\"\n\nDwayne Thorpe comments in Mythlore that family trees are one of the elements that Tolkien used to make Middle-earth seem real:\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nPrimary\n\nSecondary\n\nSources\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n\nMiddle-earth themes\nFictional family trees\nThemes of The Lord of the Rings"}

{"eng_Latn":"Hazel Bertha Hill (21 July 1920 \u2013 28 September 2010) was a British Child Psychiatrist,  probably best known for her contribution in changing an Air Ministry specification of firepower to be carried by new fighter aircraft before the Second World War.\n\nEarly life\nHill was born in London to Frederick William Hill and his wife Bertha (n\u00e9e Underwood).\n\nShe was only 13 when she helped her father calculate how many guns the new generation of Spitfires and Hurricanes would need to bring down enemy aircraft. The pair used calculating machines, which were rudimentary computers, at the kitchen table of their London home. The new plane was to have four guns that fired 1,200 bullets a minute and many thought that this would be more than enough. Her father was not so sure. In June and July 1934 they worked at night to create the evidence that her father's boss needed to underwrite a large change in the design. They realised that 256 bullets would be required in two seconds to bring down an enemy bomber at the increased speeds of the new aircraft, and for this eight guns were required.\n\nHazel's son, Robin, said he thinks his mother enjoyed maths because she was partially dyslexic and had trouble with spelling. This led to some teachers thinking she was being naughty as she was obviously intelligent. \"I think when she did mathematics, she had none of these problems, which is why it appealed to her so much,\" Robin said.\n\nThe RAF publicly acknowledged Hill's important role in a BBC documentary. Group Captain James Beldon said: \"What a great inspiration to young people today, and young girls in particular, who can look upon someone like Hazel in the 1930s making such an important contribution to our later success in the Battle of Britain, which was vital to this country's survival.\"\n\nLater life\nAfter school, Hill studied medicine at a university in London and joined the Royal Army Medical Corps after graduating in 1943. At the end of the war, she became a GP and in 1948 married Chris Baker, who was one of the soldiers she had treated in the war. The couple moved to Wednesbury, West Midlands, where she got a job setting up a child health clinic in the newly formed National Health Service. She later trained as a psychiatrist becoming a founder member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 1972. She published research into school phobia, anorexia and autism.\n\nShe had four sons: Robin, Richard, Frank and Ted.\n\nShe died, age 90, in 2010.\n\nReferences\n\n1920 births\n2010 deaths\n\nRoyal Army Medical Corps officers\nBritish general practitioners\nScientists with dyslexia\nBritish scientists with disabilities\nBritish psychiatrists\n20th-century British mathematicians\n21st-century British mathematicians"}

He had a successful karting career winning the Finnish championship in Cadet (2010), Raket (2014) and OKJ classes (2016).\n\nFormula STCC Nordic \nIn 2017, Alatalo made his single-seater debut in Formula STCC Nordic with Kart In Club Driving Academy. Alatalo won one race at Anderstorp and finished the season 5th with 142 points.\n\nItalian F4 Championship \nAlatalo moved to the Italian F4 Championship for 2018 where he spent two years driving for M\u00fccke Motorsport. The two seasons in Italy netted him one win and another podium finish in 42 races.\n\nFormula Renault Eurocup \nIn 2020 Alatalo contested the Formula Renault Eurocup driving for JD Motorsport. He achieved two podiums and a pole position during the season and finished 8th in the standings with 92 points.\n\nFormula Regional European Championship\n\n2021 \n\nThe following year, Alatalo moved to Arden Motorsport, partnering Alex Quinn and Nicola Marinangeli in the Formula Regional European Championship. His campaign proved to be consistent, with Alatalo finishing every race and being outside of the top ten on only seven occasions. The Finn's best result would end up being a third place at the Circuit Paul Ricard, and he finished the season in eleventh place, two positions behind Quinn.\n\n2022 \nAlatalo was called up to replace Santiago Ramos at the season finale in Mugello with KIC Motorsport, a month after the final round of Alatalo's F3 season.\n\nFIA Formula 3 Championship \n\nIn 2022 Alatalo made the step-up to the FIA Formula 3 Championship with Jenzer Motorsport, having taken part in a number of test days with the Swiss team in the winter. Upon the announcement of his signing, Alatalo commented that this move brought him \"one step closer to [his] dream\". He managed to score a points in the first feature race at Bahrain, and followed that up with another point in the next feature race in Imola, benefiting from a penalty for Ollie Bearman. The Finnish driver then went on a points-scoring drought lasting five races, until he managed to collect four points in tricky weather conditions at the Red Bull Ring. Two point-less races in Budapest would come before a fruitful weekend at Spa: there, Alatalo took points in both races, ending up sixth on Saturday and seventh in the feature race. Despite this, a mistake at the restart of the sprint race, where he went into the gravel and lost four positions, cost him a chance at a higher position, which Alatalo took full blame for and described as having been \"quite rubbish\".

He started as a people leader and has been instrumental in creation of multiple workers union and welfare initiatives. He was the president of Cuttack Bancho Committee, an all party initiate created in 2006, which has played a key role in the development of  Cuttack.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2012, he was the face of the communist movement in Odisha. Due to incompetent leadership and internal disputes within CPIM, he joined BJD (Biju Janta Dal) in July 2013.  At the time CPIM was directly supporting BJD government in Odisha.  BJD Chief and Odisha CM Sri Naveen Patnaik personally welcomed Mr.Singh  to Biju Janta Dal and said \"He is a asset for the Party\".\n\nRight after joining BJD, Mr.Singh became the state spokesperson for BJD and has been vocal about various developmental schemes by the government ever since. In 2014, he was selected as the Chairman of OB&OCWWB (Odisha Building & Other construction workers Welfare Board). Under his leadership the labor welfare  board (OB&OCWWB) enrolled over 28 Lakhs workers and dispersed direct benefits to 20 Lakhs+ workers. His performance was not only recognized by the state and central government but also International Labor Organisation.\n\nHe continued to advise the state government on various welfare schemes including Jaga Mission, which guarantees permanent settlement for slum dwellers in Odisha.

{"eng_Latn":"Fleet Brook is a small river in northern Hampshire, England and tributary of the River Hart.\n\nRoute\n\nThe source is somewhere near the town of Fleet, and the river that flows out from Fleet Pond is marked as Fleet Brook by the Ordnance Survey. The permanent streams that flow into Fleet Pond are known as the Gelvert and Brookly Streams.  They are all treated as part of Fleet Brook by the Environment Agency, for the purposes of monitoring water quality.\n\nReservoirs near Parkhurst Hill are \u2116s 1-5 to exclude non-existent 4, south-east of Fleet. Their water treatment is north of \u21162. The Environment Agency measure water quality from downstream of the intake. The Gelvert stream wends north, passing under Bourley Road, and is joined by another, which rises from a spring to the west. The stream gets its name from Gelvert Bottom, marshy terrain as it passes under Aldershot Road.  Another stream and surface water drains join before it is crossed by the A323 Norris Hill Road and passes under the Basingstoke Canal where it receives overflow water from a pair of weirs. Others join before it dissipates into reed beds on the south-eastern edge of Fleet Pond.\n\nThe Brookly stream begins on Greendane Copse, a little to the north-west of the reservoirs. It is culverted under a sports ground, and then reappears until it reaches Aldershot Road, beyond which it crosses housing estates in Church Crookham and Fleet, largely in culvert, but with short open sections. In Oakley Park, it is exposed again, and has an inflowing stream, an overflow on the Basingstoke Canal, and passes under the A323 road and Albany Road to reach the south end of the park. Three more bridges carry the B3010 Kings Road, Southby Drive, and Avondale Road over the watercourse.  At this point it is joined by a further stream described below.  It then flows into the south-west corner of Fleet Pond.\n\nA third stream begins in the Forest of Eversley near a five-sided enclosure, the ex-Church Crookham Military sewage works, licensed to discharge at most 1.56 Ml per day in the early 1990s. The stream passes by Fleet Infants School, designed by Michael Hopkins and Partners replacing the Victorian school, under the canal and through housing estates, remaining on the surface until it reaches Brookly Gardens, beneath which it is now culverted to join the second stream. An old OS  shows that this stream originally entered Fleet Pond directly and shows a Brookly Bridge over it. The school is statutorily recognised and protected as grade II listed. The teachers and the architect saw that the boggy heath, south not be drained for playing fields, but kept as a biodiverse habitat enhancing learning.\n\nFleet Pond is part of a nature reserve, and covers around half of the  of the designated Site of Special Scientific Interest.\n\nA weir maintains the level of it. The river exits over it, passes under the A3013 Cove Road, and runs parallel to Minley Road. It then crosses under the road and heads north-west through Broomhurst Wood, under the M3 motorway and is joined by Minley Brook on its right bank. Formerly, this section was less important, and the main river continued northwards from before the Minley Road Bridge. Fleet millpond and Mill were located just to the north of the bridge, but an office block has been built on the site. Beyond Ancells Road, the original course is still in water, passing under Barley Way and the M3 motorway and then weaving between buildings at Brook House, to join Minley Brook. It is now marked as a drain on maps. Minley Brook rises a little further to the east as a series of drains and springs in marshy ground. Brook House is not a listed structure, but predates the town of Fleet by at least 50 years, and possibly considerably more. It appeared as Brook Farm on maps from 1806, when it was already well-established. The remains of a brick-lined moat are located close to the house, and this is a locally listed asset because of its archaeological interest. The stable block and clock tower contain a clock manufactured by John Moore & Sons of Clerkenwell in 1830, and repaired by Smith & Sons, also of Clerkenwell, in 1921.\n\nBeyond the junction with Minley Brook, the main river continues westwards, taking treated sewage from the Fleet works on its left bank. In 1991 it was licensed to discharge at most 23.7 Ml per day into the river. A little further downstream from the works, the river passes under Pale Lane Bridge. After meandering across partially wooded countryside, it is crossed by Home Farm Lane, and briefly enters Elvetham Park, the grounds of Elvetham Hall, where it joins the Hart on the park's north limit near Hartley Wintney.\n\nMilling\nThere is clear evidence for at least one water mill on the Fleet Brook. Isaac Taylor's map of Hampshire, produced in 1759, names Fleet Mill, Fleet Pond and Fleet Farm, and it was marked as a corn mill in 1872. It continued in use until around 1940, and in 1990, English Heritage inspected it to see whether it should become a listed building, but decided that it did not have sufficient merit. The site is now occupied by office buildings, although a small part of the mill has been incorporated into the design.\n\nWater quality\nThe Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. Components used to determine this include biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish, and chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations. Chemical status is rated good or fail.\n\nThe water quality of the Fleet Brook was, in 2019:\n\nReasons for the quality being such include: discharge from sewage treatment works; runoff from agricultural land; physical barriers such as weirs and impounding of the water which prevent the free migration of fish and other species; runoff from roads; and leaching from landfill sites.\n\nBibliography\n\nReferences\n\nExternal sources\n\nRivers of Hampshire\nLoddon catchment"}

{"eng_Latn":"The Susanville Railroad Depot is a National Register of Historic Places property in Lassen County, California in the city of Susanville. Originally constructed for the Fernley and Lassen Railway (a Southern Pacific Railroad subsidiary) in 1927 to replace an existing station building, it was closed in 1979, and in 1987 it was saved from being burnt by the fire department (as a training exercise) after local protests, being purchased instead by the Lassen Land and Trails Trust, which uses it for their office as well as maintaining a small museum.\n\nDescription\nThe station building sits on a 1.3 acre property bought from the Southern Pacific Transportation Company in November 1988. It is  by , with a bay window projecting from the center of the South side facing the abandoned railbed. It is a single story stuccoed structure on a concrete foundation under a hipped roof. The exterior is little changed, with double-hung sash windows and wooden doors; the primary change is the removal of the original gutters.\n\nThe interior was originally divided into three areas, with a waiting room (including lavatories and a phone booth) at the West end, a ticket office in the center (separated from the waiting area by a counter), and at the east end, the express office, which had its own sliding doors on both the track side and the street side of the building. Another counter and a partition separated the ticketing from the express area, so that there was a short hallway from the latter to the waiting room. The original floor was linoleum, the walls pine tongue-and-groove wainscotting with decorative moldings. Other furnishings were also pine, with brass hardware.\n\nIn the 1950s, the counter on the passenger side of the ticket office was removed, and part of the express room was partitioned off and had its ceiling lowered, with the effect of eliminating the hallway as well. Renovation undid much of this, as well as involving the replacement of damaged fixtures and the installation of a new furnace and a security system. The linoleum was replaced with a painted pattern on the floor. A redwood deck was added at the East end, the parking lot was paved, and the area landscaped with native plants. A section of the original track remains on the south side of the station.\n\nHistory\nThe Fernley and Lassen Railway was constructed by the Southern Pacific in 1912\u20131914 to serve lumbering companies in Lassen County around Westwood, originating at the SP main line in Fernley, Nevada. Passing through Susanville, a depot was opened in a boxcar in April 1913, replaced in September of that year with a combination station\/freight shed. By 1927 that facility was proving inadequate, and the current station building was built adjacent to the original station, providing new passenger facilities while the older building served freight and baggage storage only. Passenger service ended in 1933, a victim of the Great Depression, but freight use continued until 1956, when the line was washed out west of town at a trestle. It being uneconomic to repair, rail service ceased on the line, but the station remained in use for office space and storage until October 1979, upon the abandonment of the entire line. The station sat vacant and was vandalized, to the point where in 1987 it was offered to the fire department to be burnt in a training exercise.  This sparked opposition, and a nonprofit was formed to purchase and maintain the building, which was renovated starting in 1993 and reopened the following year. In the meantime, the original 1913 structure burned in 1989, leaving the existing 1927 building standing alone.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service awarded two Challenge Cost Share Grants totaling $88,584 for renovation of the interior and exterior of the building. \n\nThe depot now houses the Trust's offices as well as a museum. The Bizz Johnson Trail begins at the station and heads west along the old right-of-way. The trust hosts various events at the station including an annual \"Rails to Trails\" festival in the fall.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Lassen Land and Trails Trust Bizz Johnson Trail website\n\nNational Register of Historic Places in Lassen County, California\nBuildings and structures completed in 1927\nRailway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in California\nFormer Southern Pacific Railroad stations in California"}

{"eng_Latn":"Vitus of Kotor, also Vito and Vita (c. 1275 \u2013 after 1335) was an architect from Kotor who is known for the construction of the Visoki De\u010dani monastery.\n\nBiography\nHe was born in Kotor, at the time part of the Kingdom of Serbia (now Montenegro) and studied construction in Kotor where he joined the Franciscan monastery and became a monk and a master-builder with his own workshop. His organizational skills and ability to gather the best craftsmen from surrounding regions, including Dubrovnik (at the time part of the Republic of Ragusa), earned him a reputation. He was personally commissioned by Serbian kings Stefan Milutin and Stefan De\u010danski to build Visoki De\u010dani.\n\nHis full name is recorded variously by historians, Vito Trifunov (of Tryphon, referring to an ancestor) \u010cu\u010dola or possibly \u010cu\u010da, Kotoranin (of Kotor). This is based on an inscription on the portal of the southern gate of De\u010dani, but only 20th century work by historians Risto Kovijani\u0107 and Ivo Stjep\u010devi\u0107 correlated the person to the records in Kotor.\n\nThe initial construction on Visoki De\u010dani Monastery occurred between 1327 and 1335 during the reign of Stefan De\u010danski. The monastery is situated in the valley of the Bistrica river surrounded by the mountains and forests of the Prokletije mountain range in the disputed territory of Kosovo. Today's analysis of the sculpture and architecture of De\u010dani offers many clues to the authorship of sculptures of saints and a mausoleum in Banjska and series of churches in Kotor (including a basilica) of the 14th century that is attributable to Fra Vito from Kotor who built a similar mausoleum in De\u010dani.\n\nVitus is credited for the construction of the monastery church at De\u010dani which began in early 1327. The church was dedicated to Christ Pantocrator. King Stefan De\u010danski commissioned the construction to a group of master-builders headed by master Vitus of Kotor and under the supervision of Archbishop, later Saint, Danilo II. In 1330, Stefan De\u010danski granted a charter for the monastery with an endowment to support the monastery in perpetuity. Stefan's remains are preserved in the De\u010dani church in a coffin at the head of the altar.\n\nVitus of Kotor is also credited with Our Lady of Ljevi\u0161, an early 14th-century Serbian Orthodox church in Prizren. Stefan Milutin, King of Serbia commissioned its rebuilding and expansion in 1306 on the site of a Byzantine basilica of the 11th century. The Byzantine church had three naves to which Milutin added two more. The architecture of the rebuilt church utilized Late Byzantine architecture through the use of five domes, monumental inscriptions in its exterior, narthex interior. and the Byzantine belfry. Milutin chose Vitus of Kotor as the master-builder of the complex and told him to utilize Byzantine elements. Another aspect of the frescoes of Bogorodica is their depiction of Orthodox councils as a symbol that referred to the challenges the Orthodox Church faced against the Roman Catholic Church, a situation common in the borderlands between Catholicism and Orthodoxy in the Balkans.\n\nOur Lady of Ljevi\u0161 was the official name in Milutin's period although the church was popularly known as the Church of Saint Petka. After the Turkish conquest, it was turned into a mosque and the name was changed to Fatih Cami or Mehmed Fatih's mosque. It is now under the protection of UNESCO.\n\nHe died in Kotor.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n\n1275 births\n1330s deaths\nPeople from Kotor\nFranciscans\nPeople from the Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)\nMedieval architects"}

Through a skillful, reflexive parody of the movement, the editor Poljanski sought to expose Dada's limits as an artistic and spiritual current, proposing Zenitism in its stead.

{"eng_Latn":"The liberation of France () in the Second World War was accomplished through diplomacy, politics and the combined military efforts of the Allied Powers, Free French forces in London and Africa, as well as the French Resistance.\n\nNazi Germany invaded France in May 1940. Their rapid advance through the undefended Ardennes caused a crisis in the French government; the French Third Republic dissolved itself in July, and handed over absolute power to Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, an elderly hero of World War I. P\u00e9tain signed an armistice with Germany with the north and west of France under German military occupation. P\u00e9tain, charged with calling a Constitutional Authority, instead established an authoritarian government in the spa town of Vichy, in the southern zone libre (\"free zone\"). Though nominally independent, Vichy France became a collaborationist regime and was little more than a Nazi client state that actively participated in Jewish deportations.\n\nEven before France surrendered on 22 June 1940, General Charles de Gaulle fled to London, from where he called on his fellow citizens to resist the Germans. The British recognized and funded  Free French government in exile based in London. Efforts to liberate France began in the autumn of 1940 in France's colonial empire in Africa, still in the hands of the Vichy regime. General  persuaded French Chad to support Free France, and by 1943 most other French colonies in Equatorial and North Africa had followed suit.  announced formation of the Empire Defense Council in Brazzaville, which became the capital of Free France.\n\nAllied military efforts in north western Europe began in summer 1944 with two seaborne invasions of France. Operation Overlord in June 1944 landed two million men, including a French armoured division, through the beaches of Normandy, opening a Western front against Germany. Operation Dragoon in August launched a second offensive force, including French Army B, from  the d\u00e9partement of Algeria into southern France. City after city in France was liberated, and even  Paris was liberated on 25 August 1944. As the liberation progressed, resistance groups were incorporated into the Allied strength. In September, under threat of the Allied advance P\u00e9tain and the remains of the Vichy regime fled into exile in Germany. The Allied armies continued to push the Germans back through eastern France and in February and March 1945, back across the Rhine into Germany. A few pockets of German resistance remained in control of the main Atlantic ports until the end of the war on 8 May 1945.\n\nImmediately after liberation, France was swept by a wave of executions, assaults, and degradation of suspected collaborators, including shaming of women suspected of relationships with Germans. Courts set up in June 1944 carried out an \u00e9puration l\u00e9gale (official purge) of officials tainted by association with Vichy or the military occupation. Some defendants received death sentences, and faced a firing squad. The first elections since 1940 were organized in May 1945 by the Provisional Government; these municipal elections were the first in which women could vote. In referendums in October 1946, the voters approved a new constitution and the Fourth Republic was born 27 October 1946.\n\nBackground\n\nFall of France\n\nNazi Germany invaded France and the Low Countries beginning on 10 May 1940. German forces split the French from their British allies by striking through the lightly defended Ardennes, whose topography French strategists had considered prohibitively difficult for tanks.\n\nThe invaders forced the British Expeditionary Force to evacuate, and defeated several French divisions before they advanced to Paris, and down the strategic Atlantic coast. By June, the dire French military situation had French politics revolving around whether the Third Republic should negotiate an armistice, fight on from North Africa, or just surrender. Prime Minister Paul Reynaud wanted to keep fighting, but was outvoted and resigned.The government relocated several times ahead of advancing German troops, ending up in Bordeaux. President Albert Lebrun appointed 84-year-old war hero Philippe P\u00e9tain as his replacement on 16 June 1940.\n\nWithin six weeks of the initial German assault, an overwhelmed French military faced imminent defeat. The cabinet agreed to seek peace terms and sent the Germans a delegation under General Charles Huntziger, with instructions to break off negotiations if the Germans demanded excessively harsh conditions such as the occupation of all of metropolitan France, the French fleet, or any of the French overseas territories. The Germans did not, however.\n\nPierre Laval, a strong proponent of collaboration, arranged a meeting between Hitler and P\u00e9tain. It took place 24 October 1940 at Montoire on Hitler's private train. P\u00e9tain and Hitler shook hands and agreed to co-operate. The meeting was exploited in Nazi propaganda for the civilian population. On 30 October 1940, P\u00e9tain made a policy of French collaboration official, declaring in a radio statement: \"I enter today on the path of collaboration.\"\n\nGeneral , sentenced to death in absentia by the Vichy r\u00e9gime escaped and created a government in exile for Free France in London. Of the sentence, he said: \"I consider the death sentence by the men of Vichy entirely void, I shall settle accounts with them after victory. The sentence is that of a court largely under the influence and possibly under the direct orders of an enemy who will one day be driven from the soil of France. Then I will submit myself willingly to the people's judgment.\"\n\nArmistice\nP\u00e9tain signed the Armistice of 22 June. Its terms left the French Army under Vichy France a rump Armistice Army. The naval fleet, although disabled, remained under Vichy control. In the colonial empire, the armistice terms permitted defensive use of the naval fleet. In metropolitan France, forces were severely reduced, armored vehicles and tanks prohibited, and motorized transport severely limited.\n\nIn July, the National Assembly of the French Third Republic dissolved itself and gave absolute power to P\u00e9tain, who was to set up a constituent assembly and constitutional referendum. The \"French State\" created by this transfer of power was commonly known after the war as the \"Vichy r\u00e9gime\". P\u00e9tain did nothing about a constitution however, and established a totalitarian government at Vichy in the southern zone.\n\nThe Vichy r\u00e9gime nominally governed all of France, but in practice the zone occup\u00e9e was a Nazi dictatorship and the Vichy government's power was limited and uncertain even in the zone libre. Vichy France became a collaborationist regime, little more than a Nazi client state.\n\nFrance was still nominally independent, with control of the French Navy, the French colonial empire, and the southern half of its metropolitan territory. France could tell itself that it still retained some shreds of dignity. Despite heavy pressure, Vichy never joined the Axis alliance and remained formally at war with Germany. The Allies took the position that France should refrain from actively helping the Germans, but distrusted its assurances. The British attacked the French Navy at anchor in Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, to keep it out of German hands.\n\nDe Gaulle and Free France\n\nCharles  had been since 5 June the Under-Secretary of State for National Defence and War and responsible for coordination with Britain. Refusing to accept his government's position on Germany, he escaped back to England on 17 June. In London he established a government in exile and in a series of radio appeals exhorted the French to fight back. Some historians have called the first, his appeal of 18 June on the BBC, the beginning of the French Resistance. In fact the audience for that appeal was quite small, but more and more listened as de Gaulle obtained Britain's recognition as the legitimate government of Free France and obtained their agreement to finance a military efforts against Nazi Germany.\n\n also tried, in vain initially, to gain the support of French forces in the French colonial empire. General Charles Nogu\u00e8s, Resident-General in Morocco and Commander-in-Chief of the Army of Africa refused his overtures, and forbade the press in French North Africa to publish the text of 's appeal. The day after the armistice was signed on 21 June 1940,  denounced it. The French government in Bordeaux declared  compulsorily retired from the Army with the rank of colonel, on 23 June 1940. Also on 23 June, the British Government denounced the armistice and announced that they no longer regarded the Bordeaux government as a fully independent state. They also noted a plan to establish a French National Committee in exile, but did not mention  by name.\n\nThe armistice took effect starting at 00:35 on 25 June. On 26 June  wrote to Churchill about recognition for his French Committee. The Foreign Office had reservations about de Gaulle as a leader, but Churchill's envoys had tried and failed to establish contact with French leaders in North Africa, so on 28 June, the British government recognized  as the leader of the Free French, despite the FO's reservations.\n\n also initially had little success in attracting the support of major powers. While P\u00e9tain's government was recognized by the US, the USSR, and the Vatican, and controlled the French fleet and military in all the colonies, 's retinue consisted of a secretary, three colonels, a dozen captains, a law professor, and three battalions of legionnaires who had agreed to stay in Britain and fight for him. For a time the New Hebrides were the only French colony to back .\n\n and Churchill reached agreement on 7 August 1940 that Britain would also fund the Free French, with the costs to be settled after the war (the financial agreement was finalized in March 1941). A separate letter guaranteed the territorial integrity of the French colonial empire.\n\nFrench Resistance\n\nThe French Resistance was a decentralized network of small cells of fighters with the tacit or overt support of many French civilians. The various resistance groups by 1944 had an estimated 100,000 members in France. Some were former Republican fighters from the Spanish Civil War; others were workers who went into hiding rather than report for the mandatory Service du travail obligatoire (STO) to work for German arms factories. In the south of France especially, Resistance fighters took to the mountainous brush () that gave them their name, and conducted guerilla warfare on the German occupation forces, cutting telephone lines and destroying bridges.\n\nThe Arm\u00e9e Secr\u00e8te was a French military organization active during World War II. The collective grouped the paramilitary formations of the three most important Gaullist resistance movements in the southern zone: Combat, Lib\u00e9ration-sud and the Franc-Tireurs.\n\nSome organizations grew up around one of the many clandestine presses of the time, such as Combat, founded by Albert Camus, to which Jean-Paul Sartre also contributed. Stalin supported the effort once Germany invaded the Soviet Union.\n\nFrench prisoners of war were held hostage against the French government meeting their quota of workers. When the mass impressment of able-bodied civilians began, French railway workers (cheminots) went on strike rather than allow the Germans to use the trains to transport them. The cheminots eventually formed their own organization, R\u00e9sistance-Fer.\n\nThe French Forces of the Interior (FFI), as  came to call Resistance forces inside France, were an uneasy alliance of several maquis and other organizations, including the Communist-organized Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP) and the Arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te in southern France. In addition, escape networks helped Allied airmen who had been shot down get to safety. The Unione Corse and the , the criminal underground of Marseilles, gleefully provided logistical escape assistance for a price, although some such as Paul Carbone instead worked with the Carlingue, French auxiliaries to the Gestapo SD and German military police.\n\nFrench colonial empire\n\nFrance's colonial empire at the start of World War II stretched from territories and possessions in Africa, the Middle East (Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon), to ports in India, Indochina, the Pacific islands, and territories in North and South America.\nFrance retained control of its colonial empire, and the terms of the armistice shifted the power balance post-armistice of France's reduced military resources away from France and towards the colonies, especially North Africa. By 1943, all French colonies, except for Japanese-controlled Indochina, had joined the Free French cause.\nThe colonies in North Africa and French Equatorial Africa in particular played a key role\n\nVichy French colonial forces were reduced under the terms of the armistice. Nevertheless, in the Mediterranean area alone, Vichy had nearly 150,000 men under arms. There were about 55,000 in French Morocco, 50,000 in Algeria, and almost 40,000 in the Army of the Levant.\n\nDiplomacy, politics, and administration\n\nDiplomacy and politics\n\nAppeal of 18 June\n\nRefusing to accept his government's armistice with Germany, Charles  fled to England on 17 June and exhorted the French to resist occupation and to continue the fight.\n\nReynaud resigned after his proposal for a Franco-British Union was rejected by his cabinet and De Gaulle facing imminent arrest, fled France on 17 June. Other leading politicians, including Georges Mandel, L\u00e9on Blum, Pierre Mend\u00e8s France, Jean Zay and \u00c9douard Daladier (and separately Reynaud), were arrested while travelling to continue the war from North Africa.\n\nDe Gaulle obtained special permission from Winston Churchill to broadcast a speech on 18 June via Radio Londres (a French language radio station operated by the BBC) to France, despite the Cabinet's objections that such a broadcast could provoke the P\u00e9tain government into a closer allegiance with Germany. In his speech, de Gaulle reminded the French people that the British Empire and the United States of America would support them militarily and economically in an effort to retake France from the Germans.\n\nFew actually heard the speech but another speech, heard by more people, was given by de Gaulle four days later.\nAfter the war, de Gaulle's radio appeal was often identified as the beginning of the French Resistance, and the process of liberating France from the yoke of German occupation.\n\nNorthern Africa\n\nDe Gaulle's support grew out of a base in colonial Africa. In the summer of 1940, the colonial empire largely supported the Vichy regime. F\u00e9lix \u00c9bou\u00e9, governor of Chad, switched his support to General de Gaulle in September. Encouraged, de Gaulle traveled to Brazzaville in October, where he announced the formation of an Empire Defense Council in his \"Brazzaville Manifesto\", and invited all colonies still supporting Vichy to join him and the Free French forces in the fight against Germany, which most of them did by 1943.\n\nOn 26 August, the governor and military commanders in the colony of French Chad announced that they were rallying to De Gaulle's Free French Forces. A small group of Gaullists seized control of French Cameroon the following morning, and on 28 August a Free French official ousted the pro-Vichy governor of French Congo. The next day the governor of Ubangi-Shari declared that his territory would support De Gaulle. His declaration prompted a brief struggle for power with a pro-Vichy army officer, but by the end of the day all of the colonies that formed French Equatorial Africa had rallied to Free France, except for French Gabon.\n\nFree French Administration\nA series of organizing bodies was created during the war, to guide and coordinate the diplomatic and war effort of Free France, with General Charles  playing a central role in the creation or operation of them all.\n\nEmpire Defense Council\n\nOn 26 June 1940, four days after the P\u00e9tain government requested the armistice, General  submitted a memorandum to the British government notifying Churchill of his decision to set up a Council of Defense of the Empire and formalizing the agreement reached with Churchill on 28 June. The formal recognition of the Empire Defense Council as a government in exile by the United Kingdom took place on 6 January 1941; recognition by the Soviet Union was published in December 1941, by exchange of letters.\n\nFrench National Committee\n\nWinston Churchill suggested that  create a committee, to lend an appearance of a more constitutionally based and less dictatorial authority and on 24 September 1941  created by edict the French National Committee as the successor organization to the smaller Empire Defense Council. According to historian   went on to accept his proposal, but took care to exclude all his adversaries within the Free France movement, such as \u00c9mile Muselier, Andr\u00e9 Labarthe and others, retaining only \"yes men\" in the group.\n\nThe committee was the coordinating body which acted as the government-in-exile of Free France from 1941 to 1943. On 3 June 1943 it merged with the French Civil and Military High Command headed by Henri Giraud, becoming the new \"French Committee of National Liberation\".\n\nNational Resistance Council\n\nDe Gaulle, began seeking the formation of a committee to unify the resistance movements. On January 1, 1942, he delegated this task to Jean Moulin. Moulin achieved this on May 27, 1943, with the first meeting of the Conseil National de la R\u00e9sistance in the 6th-arrondissement apartment of Ren\u00e9 Corbin on the second floor of 48, Rue du Four, in Paris.\n\nFrench Civil and Military High Command\n\nThe French Civil and Military High Command was the governmental body in Algiers headed by Henri Giraud following the liberation of a portion of French North Africa following the Allied Operation Torch landings on 7 and 8 November 1942.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Darlan had been named by P\u00e9tain to oppose the Allied landings in North Africa in November 1942. Following the landings, Darlan supported the Allies. On 13 November, Eisenhower recognized him and named Darlan \"High Commissioner of France residing in North Africa\". Henri Giraud, a French patriot loyal to Vichy but opposed to Germany and who had been the Allies choice, became commander of the military forces in North Africa. First called the \"High Commission of France in Africa\", the French authority was rocked when on 24 December 1942, Darlan was assassinated by a Monarchist. Giraud took over and the name \"Civil and Military High Command\" was adopted by 1943. Giraud exercised authority over French Algeria and the French Protectorate of Morocco, while the Tunisian campaign against the Germans and Italians continued in the French Protectorate of Tunisia. Darlan having previously won the support of French West Africa, the latter was also in Giraud's camp, while French Equatorial Africa was in de Gaulle's camp.\n\nBy March 1943, North Africa began to distance itself from Vichy. On 14 March, Giraud delivered a speech that he later described as \"the first democratic speech of [his] life\", in which he broke with Vichy. Jean Monnet pushed Giraud to negotiate with de Gaulle, who arrived in Algiers on 30 May 1943. On 3 June, the Civil and Military High Command in Algiers merged with the French National Committee in London to form the French National Liberation Committee.\n\nFrench Committee of National Liberation\n\nThe French Committee of National Liberation was a provisional government of Free France formed by generals Henri Giraud and Charles de Gaulle to provide united leadership, and organize and coordinate the campaign to liberate France. The committee was formed on 3 June 1943 and after a period of joint leadership came under the chairmanship of  on 9 November. The committee directly challenged the legitimacy of the Vichy r\u00e9gime and unified the French forces that fought against the Nazis and their collaborators. The committee functioned as a provisional government for French Algeria (then a part of metropolitan France) and the liberated parts of the colonial empire.\n\nThe committee was formed on 3 June 1943 in Algiers, the capital of French Algeria. Giraud and de Gaulle served jointly as co-presidents of the committee. The charter of the body affirmed its commitment to \"re-establish all French liberties, the laws of the Republic and the Republican r\u00e9gime.\" The committee saw itself as a source of unity and representation for the French nation. The Vichy regime was decried as illegitimate over its collaboration with Nazi Germany. The committee received mixed responses from the Allies; the U.S. and Britain considered it a war-time body with restricted functions, different from a future government of liberated France. The Committee soon expanded its membership, developed a distinctive administrative body and incorporated as the Provisional Consultative Assembly, creating an organized, representative government within itself. With Allied recognition, the committee and its leaders Giraud and de Gaulle enjoyed considerable popular support within France and the French resistance, thus becoming the forerunners in the process to form a provisional government for France as liberation approached. However, Charles de Gaulle politically outmaneuvered Gen. Giraud, and asserted complete control and leadership over the committee.\n\nIn August 1944 the Committee moved to Paris following the liberation of France by Allied forces.\n\nIn September, Allied forces recognized the committee as the legitimate provisional government of France, whereupon the Committee reorganized itself as the Provisional Government of the French Republic under the presidency of Charles  and began the process of writing a new Constitution which would become the basis of the French Fourth Republic.\n\nProvisional Consultative Assembly\n\nThe Provisional Consultative Assembly was set up in September 1943 in Algiers to advise the committee and to help provide a legal basis to the institutions being set up to represent the French people, at a time when the country itself and its laws represented the enemy. After the liberation of Paris in August 1944, the Committee moved to Paris and was reorganized as the Provisional Government of the French Republic under the presidency of Charles . The Provisional Government guided the French war and diplomatic efforts through liberation and the end of the war, until a new Constitution was written and approved in a referendum, establishing of the Fourth Republic in October 1946.\n\nThe Provisional Consultative Assembly was a governmental organ of Free France that was created by and operated under the aegis of the French Committee of National Liberation (CFLN). It began in north Africa and held meetings in Algiers until it moved to Paris in July 1944. Led by Charles de Gaulle, it was an attempt to provide some sort of representative, democratic accountability to the institutions being set up to represent the French people, at a time when the country itself and its laws were dissolved and its territory occupied or coopted by a puppet state.\n\nThe members of the Assembly represented the French resistance movements, political parties, and territories that were engaged against Germany in the Second World War alongside the Allies.\n\nEstablished by ordinance on 17 September 1943 by the CFLN, it held its first meetings in Algiers, at the Palais Carnot (the former headquarters of the Financial Delegations), between 3 November 1943 and 25 July 1944. On 3 June 1944 it was placed under the authority of the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF), which succeeded the CFLN.\n\nIn his inaugural speech, de Gaulle gave the body his imprimatur, as providing a means of representing the people of France as democratically and legally as possible under difficult and unparalleled circumstances, until such time as democracy could once again be restored. As an indication of the importance he attached to the body, de Gaulle participated in about twenty sessions of the Consultative Assembly in Algiers. On 26 June 1944, he came to report on the military situation after the D-Day landings, and on 25 July, he was present at its last session on African soil before its move to Paris.\n\nRestructured and expanded after the liberation of France, it held sessions in Paris at the Palais du Luxembourg between 7 November 1944 and 3 August 1945.\n\nProvisional Government\n\nThe GPFR served as an interim government of Free France from June 1944 through liberation and lasted till 1946.\n\nThe PGFR was created by the Committee of National Liberation on 3 June 1944, three days before D-day. It moved back to Paris after the liberation of the capital in August 1944.\n\nMost of the goals and activity of the GPFR are related to the post-Liberation period, so this subtopic is covered in more detail in the Aftermath section below, in section Provisional Government of the French Republic.\n\nMilitary forces\n\nIntroduction\nThe first military forces brought to bear in the liberation of France were the forces of Free France, made up of colonial regiments from French Africa. The Free French forces included 300,000 North African Arabs. Two of the Big Three Allies, the United States and the United Kingdom, were next with Operation Overlord, with Australian air support and Canadian infantry in the Normandy beach landings.\n\nIndividual civilian efforts such as the Maquis de Saint-Marcel helped to harass the Germans. An OSE operation hid Allied servicemen. The many scattered cells of the French Resistance gradually consolidated into a fighting force after the Normandy landings and became known as the French Forces of the Interior (FFI). The FFI made major contributions, assisting Allied armies pushing the Germans east out of France and past the Rhine.\n\nThe military forces involved in the liberation of France were under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, commander of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). General Bernard Montgomery was named commander of the 21st Army Group, which comprised all of the land forces involved in the initial invasion. On 31 December 1943, Eisenhower and Montgomery first saw the outline plan the Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC) had prepared for an invasion, which proposed amphibious landings by three divisions, with two more divisions in support. The two generals immediately insisted on expanding the scale of the initial invasion to five divisions, with airborne descents by three additional divisions, to allow operations on a wider front and to speed up the capture of the port at Cherbourg. The need to acquire or produce extra landing craft for the expanded operation meant delaying the invasion until June 1944. Eventually the Allies committed 39 divisions to the Battle of Normandy: 22 American, 12 British, three Canadian, one Polish, and one French, totalling over a million troops, all under overall British command.\n\nFree French Forces\n\nDespite 's call to continue the struggle, few French forces initially pledged their support. By the end of July 1940, only about 7,000 soldiers had joined the Free French Forces in England. Three-quarters of French servicemen in Britain requested repatriation.\n\nFrance was bitterly divided by the conflict. Frenchmen everywhere were forced to choose sides, and often deeply resented those who had made a different choice. One French admiral, Ren\u00e9-\u00c9mile Godfroy, voiced the opinion of many of those who decided not to join the Free French forces, when in June 1940 he explained to the exasperated British why he would not order his ships from their Alexandria harbour to join :\n\"For us Frenchmen, the fact is that a government still exists in France, a government supported by a Parliament established in non-occupied territory and which in consequence cannot be considered irregular or deposed. The establishment elsewhere of another government, and all support for this other government would clearly be rebellion.\"\n\nEqually, few Frenchmen believed that Britain could stand alone. In June 1940, P\u00e9tain and his generals told Churchill that \"in three weeks, England will have her neck wrung like a chicken\". Of France's far-flung empire, only the 43 acres of French territory of the British island of St Helena (on 23 June at the initiative of Georges Colin, honorary consul of the domains) and the Franco-British ruled New Hebrides in the Pacific (on 20 July) answered 's call to arms. It was not until late August that Free France would gain significant support in French Equatorial Africa.\n\nUnlike the troops at Dunkirk or naval forces at sea, relatively few members of the French Air Force had the means or opportunity to escape. Like all military personnel trapped on the mainland, they were functionally subject to the P\u00e9tain government: \"French authorities made it clear that those who acted on their own initiative would be classed as deserters, and guards were placed to thwart efforts to get on board ships.\" In the summer of 1940, around a dozen pilots made it to England and volunteered for the RAF to help fight the Luftwaffe. Many more, however, made their way through long and circuitous routes to Spain or to French territories overseas, eventually regrouping as the Free French Air Force.\n\nThe French Navy was better able to immediately respond to 's call to arms. Most units initially stayed loyal to Vichy, but about 3,600 sailors operating 50 ships around the world joined with the Royal Navy and formed the nucleus of the Free French Naval Forces (FFNF; in French Forces Navales Fran\u00e7aises Libres: FNFL). France's surrender found her only aircraft carrier, , en route from the United States loaded with  American fighter and bomber aircraft. Unwilling to return to occupied France, but likewise reluctant to join , B\u00e9arn instead sought harbour in Martinique, her crew showing little inclination to side with the British in their continued fight against the Nazis. Already obsolete at the start of the war, she remained in Martinique for the next four years, her aircraft rusting in the tropical climate.\n\nMany men in the French colonies felt a special need to defend France, and eventually made up two-thirds of \u2019s Free French Forces. Among these volunteers, influential psychiatrist and decolonial philosopher Frantz Fanon from Martinique joined \u2019s troops at the age of 18, despite being deemed a \u2018dissenter\u2019 by Martinique's Vichy-controlled colonial government for doing so.\n\nColonial African forces\n\nThe contribution to France's liberation made by African colonial soldiers, who comprised 9% of the French army, was long overlooked. The North African units, dating from 1830 and grouped into the XIX Army Corps in 1873, formed part of the French Metropolitan Army. De Gaulle made a base in African territory, from which he launched the military liberation. African troops who made the largest contribution by colonial troops to the liberation.\n\nOn the eve of the Second World War, five regiments of Tirailleurs S\u00e9n\u00e9galais were stationed in France in addition to a brigade based in Algeria. The 2e division colonial senegalaise was permanently deployed in the south of France due to the potential threat of invasion from Italy.\n\nThe Arm\u00e9e d\u2019Afrique (Army of Africa) was formally a separate army corps of the French metropolitan army, the 19th Army Corps (19e Corps d'Arm\u00e9e) so named in 1873. The French Colonial Forces on the other hand came under the Ministry of the Navy and comprised both French and indigenous units serving in Sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere in the French colonial empire.\n\nIntelligence\n set up his Free French intelligence system to combine both military and political roles, including covert operations. He selected journalist Pierre Brossolette (1903\u201344) to head the Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action (BCRA). The policy was reversed in 1943 by Emmanuel d'Astrier, the interior minister of the exile government, who insisted on civilian control of political intelligence.\n\nAllied forces\n\nThe \"Big Three\" Allies of World War II, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, all fought Germany in World War II, but Soviet Union fighting on the Eastern Front played no direct role in the liberation of France, but the second front contributed to Nazi defeat.\n\nThe United Kingdom and the United States fought on the Western Front, with contributions from Canadian and Australian soldiers who  landed in Normandy on D-Day, as well as Australian air support.\n\nFrench Forces of the Interior\n\nFrench Forces of the Interior was the formal name given by General de Gaulle to French resistance fighters in the later stages of the war; the change occurred as France, the occupied nation, became France, being liberated by the Allied armies. Regional maquis became more formally organized into FFI light infantry and served as a valuable additional manpower for the regular Free French forces.\n\nAfter the invasion of Normandy in June 1944, at the request of the French Committee of National Liberation, SHAEF placed about 200,000 resistance fighters under the command of General Marie Pierre K\u0153nig on 23 June 1944 who attempted to unify resistance efforts against the Germans. General Eisenhower confirmed Koenig's command of the FFI .\n\nThe FFI were mostly composed of resistance fighters who used their own weapons, although many FFI units included former French soldiers. They used civilian clothing and wore an armband with the letters \"F.F.I.\"\n\nAccording to General Patton, the rapid advance of his army through France would have been impossible without the fighting aid of the FFI. General Patch estimated that from the time of the Mediterranean landings to the arrival of U.S. troops at Dijon, the help given to the operations by the FFI was equivalent to four full divisions.\n\nFFI units seized bridges, began the liberation of villages and towns as Allied units neared, and collected intelligence on German units in the areas entered by the Allied forces, easing the Allied advance through France in August 1944. According to a volume of the U.S. official history of the war, In Brittany, southern France, and the area of the Loire and Paris, French Resistance forces greatly aided the pursuit to the Seine in August. Specifically, they supported the U.S. Third Army in Brittany and the Seventh U.S. and First French Armies in the southern beachhead and the Rh\u00f4ne valley. In the advance to the Seine, the French Forces of the Interior helped protect the southern flank of the Third Army by interfering with enemy railroad and highway movements and enemy telecommunications, by developing open resistance on as wide a scale as possible, by providing tactical intelligence, by preserving installations of value to the Allied forces, and by mopping up bypassed enemy positions.\n\nAs regions of France were liberated, the FFI provided a ready pool of semi-trained manpower with which France could rebuild the French Army. Estimated to have a strength of 100,000 in June 1944, the strength of the FFI grew rapidly, doubling by July 1944, and reaching 400,000 by October 1944. Although the amalgamation of the FFI was in some cases fraught with political difficulty, it was ultimately successful and allowed France to re-establish a reasonably large army of 1.3 million men by VE Day.\n\nEscape lines\n\nApproximately 2,000 British and 3,000 American airmen downed in western Europe evaded German capture during the war. Airmen were assisted by many different escape lines, some of them large and organized, others informal and ephemeral. The Royal Air Forces Escaping Society estimated that 14,000 volunteers worked with the many escape and evasion lines during the war. Many others helped on an occasional basis, and the total number of people who, on one or more occasions helped downed airmen during the war, may have reached 100,000. One-half of the volunteer helpers were women, often young women, even teenagers.\n\nEscape and evasion lines created by the Allies specifically to assist their men, such as the Shelbourne or the Burgundy lines or those created by servicemen at large in occupied territory, such as the Pat O'Leary Line, usually focused on helping Allied servicemen. Other escape lines, grass-roots efforts by civilians to help those fleeing the Nazis, such as the Comet, Dutch-Paris, Service EVA or the Smit-van der Heijden lines, also helped servicemen but also compromised spies, resisters, men evading the forced labor impressments, civilians who wanted to join the governments-in-exile in London, and fleeing Jews.\n\nPremature activation\nIn the uplands and forests, considerable numbers of resistance fighters gathered, known as maquisards because of the maquis shrubland that sheltered them. These \"redoubts\" of FFI fighters initially kept a low profile, since overt acts of sabotage resulted in savage reprisals by German forces, or direct military action on a large scale. On 26 March 1944, the Maquis des Gli\u00e8res in Haute-Savoie were defeated by more than 3,000 troops followed by shootings and burnings of farms amongst the local population.\n\nExcluded from the planning for the Normandy Landings,  and his staff devised an operation called Plan Ca\u00efman in which French paratroopers would join the maquisards of the Massif Central to liberate the surrounding area and from there establish contact with the invading British and US forces. The Allied planners rejected the plan on the grounds that they would not have the resources to support it. On 20 May 1944, the Maquis du Mont Mouchet in the Massif Central staged an open uprising on its own initiative and was crushed within three weeks with the usual reprisals. Despite this, on 6 June,  broadcast an impassioned call to arms to the French people on the BBC, which the maquisards interpreted as a signal for overt action; a lower-key message from Eisenhower to avoid a \"premature uprising\" was widely ignored. As a direct consequence, in July the 4,000 FFI on the Vercors Plateau near Grenoble were attacked by a German force of 10,000 including paratroopers and troops in gliders. In the Battle of Vercors, the lightly armed French defences were overwhelmed, despite assistance from Allied agents, air-drops and special forces.\n\nAllied military policy\n\nMilitary strategy for the war as a whole was discussed among the Big Three powers, and especially among the United Kingdom and the United States, who were especially close, with numerous calls and meetings held between U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In addition, the leaders of the Big Three met at conferences during the war to decide on overall military strategy.\n\nThe Arcadia Conference held in Washington, D.C. from December 22, 1941, to January 14, 1942, followed the American and the British declarations of war on Japan; Japan's allies, Germany and Italy, declared war on the United States. The main policy decisions of Arcadia included the \"Germany First\" (also known as \"Europe first\") policy that the defeat of Germany had higher priority than the war with Japan.\n\nThe Second Washington Conference in June 1942 confirmed a decision not to open a second front in France but to first invade French North Africa as part of a joint Mediterranean strategy for an attack on Italy (described as the \"soft under-belly\" of the Axis).\n\nThe decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion in 1944 was taken at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943. General Eisenhower was appointed commander of SHAEF and General Bernard Montgomery was named as commander of the 21st Army Group, which comprised all the land forces involved in the invasion. The coast of Normandy in northwestern France was chosen as the site of the invasion.\n\nThe Tehran Conference (28 November to 1 December 1943) a strategy meeting of the Big Three leaders Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill held at the Soviet Union's embassy in Tehran had numerous objectives, and led to the commitment of the western Allies to open a second front in the war in the west.\n\nCampaigns\n\nAfter the Fall of France, the battle to retake France began in Africa in November 1940. By September 1944, after the liberation of Paris and the southern France campaign and taking of Mediterranean ports in Marseille and Toulon, the country was largely liberated. The Allied Forces were driving into Germany from the west and the south. The liberation of France didn't finally end till the elimination of some pockets of German resistance along the Atlantic coast at the end of the war in May 1945.\n\nMilitarily, the liberation of France was part of the Western Front of World War II. Other than scattered raids in 1942 and 1943, the reconquest began in earnest in the summer of 1944 in parallel campaigns in the north and south of France. On 6 June 1944, the Allies began Operation Overlord, the largest seaborne invasion in history, establishing a beachhead in Normandy, landing two million men in northern France and opening another front in western Europe against Germany. American forces broke out from Normandy at the end of July. At the Falaise Pocket the Allied armies destroyed German forces, opening the route to Paris. In the south, the Allies launched Operation Dragoon on 15 August, opening a new military front on the Mediterranean. In four weeks, the Germans retreated from southern France to Germany. This left French ports in Allied hands, resolving earlier supply problems in the south. Under the onslaught from both directions, the French Resistance organized a general uprising in Paris on 19 August. On 25 August 1944 Paris was liberated. The Allied forces began to push towards the Rhine. Initial rapid advances in the North stretched lines of supply in the autumn, and the advance slowed. German counteroffensives in the winter of 1944\u201345 such as the Battle of the Bulge slowed but did not stop the Allied armies, some crossing the Rhine in February, with heavy German losses. By late March several Allied armies had crossed and began advancing rapidly into Germany, with the end of the war not far away. With France mostly liberated, a few pockets of German resistance remained until the end of the war in May 1945.\n\nGabon \u2013 November 1940\n\nThe Battle of Gabon resulted in the Free French Forces taking the colony of French Gabon and its capital, Libreville, from Vichy French forces. It was the only significant engagement in Central Africa during the war.\n\nNorth Africa \u2013 November 1942\n\nTorch\n\nOperation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa, was carried out to trap Axis forces in North Africa between two Allied armies \u2013 an Anglo-American one in the west and a British and Commonwealth one in the east; this would also permit an invasion of Italy and free the Mediterranean for shipping. It would be the first ground combat operations for American troops in the west. In a three-pronged Allied assault against Vichy r\u00e9gime targets in French North Africa, the landing forces of Operation Torch came in at Casablanca, Oran and Algiers. Following Case Anton, French colonial governors had found themselves taking orders from the German military administration, and did so with varying degrees of enthusiasm.  The American consul in Algiers believed that Vichy forces would welcome American soldiers.\n\nA Western Task Force (aimed at Casablanca) was composed of American units, with Major General George S. Patton in command and Rear Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt heading naval operations. This Western Task Force consisted of the U.S. 3rd and 9th Infantry Divisions, and two battalions from the U.S. 2nd Armored Division \u2014 35,000 troops in a convoy of over 100 ships. They were transported directly from the United States in the first of a new series of UG convoys providing logistical support for the North African campaign.\n\nThe Center Task Force, aimed at Oran, included the U.S. 2nd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division and the U.S. 1st Armored Division\u2014a total of 18,500 troops.\n\nThe Eastern Task Force\u2014aimed at Algiers\u2014was commanded by Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson and consisted of a brigade from the British 78th and the U.S. 34th Infantry Divisions, along with two British commando units (No. 1 and No. 6 Commandos), together with the RAF Regiment providing five squadrons of infantry and five Light anti-aircraft flights, totalling 20,000 troops. During the landing, ground forces were commanded by U.S. Major General Charles W. Ryder, of the 34th Division and naval forces were commanded by Royal Navy Vice-Admiral Sir Harold Burrough.\n\nThe plan to install Henri Giraud as governor of the freed territories did not get local support but the Vichy commander in chief of French armed forces Fran\u00e7ois Darlan had been captured during the operation and was installed as High Commissioner, in return for which he ordered French forces in North Africa to cooperate with the Allies. Darlan was assassinated by an anti-Vichy monarchist and Giraud then took over. The Darlan deal triggered the invasion of Vichy France by Germany.\n\nTunisian campaign\n\nFrench Tunisia had been a protectorate of France since 1881, when it became part of France's colonial empire.\n\nAfter the Operation Torch landings in Morocco and Algiers the Allied forces moved eastwards into Tunisia as British forces moved west following the Second Battle of El Alamein. The Axis forces in North Africa were reinforced but subsequently cut off from resupply and caught between the two armies. The Allies took Bizerte and Tunis in May 1943 and the remaining Italian and German forces in North Africa surrendered. The Allies now had all of North Africa as a base of operations against southern Europe.\n\nCorsica \u2013 1943\n\nExcept for a brief period, Corsica had been under the control of France since the Treaty of Versailles (1768). In World War II, Corsica was occupied by the Kingdom of Italy from November 1942, through September 1943. Italy initially occupied the island (as well as parts of France) as part of Nazi Germany's Case Anton on 11 November 1942. At its peak, Italy had 85,000 troops on the island. There was some native support among Corsican irredentists for the occupation. Benito Mussolini postponed the annexation of Corsica by Italy until after an assumed Axis victory in World War II, mainly because of German opposition to the irredentist claims.\n\nAlthough there was mild support for the occupation among collaborationists and resistance was initially limited, it grew after the Italian invasion and by April 1943 became united, and was armed by airdrop and shipments by the Free French submarine Casabianca and establish some territorial control.\n\nAfter Mussolini's imprisonment in July 1943, German troops took over the occupation of Corsica. The Allied invasion of Italy began 3 September 1943, leading to Italy's surrender to the Allies, with the main invasion force landing in Italy on 9 September. The local resistance signaled an uprising for the same day, beginning the liberation of Corsica (Operation Vesuvius).\n\nThe Allies did not initially want such a movement, preferring to focus their forces on the invasion of Italy. However, in light of the insurrection, the Allies acquiesced to Free French troops landing on Corsica, starting with an elite detachment of the reconstituted French I Corps landing (again by the submarine Casabianca) at Arone near the village of Piana in northwest Corsica. This prompted the German troops to attack Italian troops in Corsica as well as the Resistance. The Resistance, and the Italian 44 Infantry Division Cremona and 20 Infantry Division Friuli engaged in heavy combat with the German Sturmbrigade Reichsf\u00fchrer SS. The Sturmbrigade was joined by the 90th Panzergrenadier Division and the Italian XII Paratroopers Battalion\/ 184th Paratroopers Regiment 184th Paratroopers Division \"Nembo\", which were retreating from Sardinia through Corsica, from Bonifacio to the northern port of Bastia. There were now 30,000 German troops in Corsica withdrawing via Bastia. On 13 September elements of the 4th Moroccan Mountain Division landed in Ajaccio to try to stop the Germans. During the night of 3 to 4 October, the last German units evacuated Bastia, leaving behind 700 dead and 350 POWs.\n\nBattle of Normandy \u2013 June 1944\n\nOperation Overlord was launched on 6 June 1944 with troops landing in Normandy. Attacks by 1,200 planes preceded an amphibious assault by more than 5,000 vessels. Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on 6 June.\n\nThe Battle of Normandy was won due to what is still today the largest ever military landing logistical operation; it brought three million soldiers, mostly American, British, and French, over the Channel from Britain.\n\nSome of the German Army units they met in this operation were Ostlegionen, part of the German 243rd and 709th Static Infantry Divisions, near the Utah, Juno and Sword invasion beaches.\n\nThe British intelligence organization, MI9, created Operation Marathon to gather downed airmen into isolated forest camps where they would await their rescue by allied military forces advancing after the Normandy Invasion of June 6, 1944. The Comet Line, a Belgian\/French escape line, operated the forest camps with financial and logistical help from MI9, which also provided support for Operation Bonaparte, another escape and evasion line for downed airmen in Normandy.\n\nParis \u2013 August 1944\n\nThe Liberation of Paris was an urban military battle that took place over the period of a week from 19 August 1944 until the German garrison surrendered the French capital on 25 August 1944. Paris had been ruled by Nazi Germany since the signing of the Armistice on 22 June 1940, after which the Wehrmacht occupied northern and western France.\n\nAs the final phase of Operation Overlord was still going on in August 1944, Eisenhower was not considering the liberation of Paris to be a primary objective. The goal of the U.S. and Anglo-Canadian armed forces was to destroy the German forces, and end World War II in Europe, to allow the Allies to concentrate their efforts on the Pacific war.\n\nUprising \u2013 15 August\n\nAs the French Resistance began to rise in Paris against the Germans on 15 August, Eisenhower stated that it was too early for an assault on Paris. He was also aware that Hitler had ordered the German military to completely destroy the city in the event of an Allied attack, and Paris was considered to have too great a value, culturally and historically, to risk its destruction.\n\nOn 15 August employees of the Paris M\u00e9tro, the Gendarmerie, and National Police went on strike; postal workers followed the next day. They were soon joined by workers across the city, causing a general strike to break out on 18 August. Barricades began to appear on 20 August, with Resistance fighters organizing themselves to sustain a siege. Trucks were positioned, trees cut down, and trenches were dug in the pavement to free paving stones for consolidating the barricades.\n\nSkirmishes reached their peak on 22 August, when some German units tried to leave their fortifications. At 09:00 on 23 August, under the orders of Dietrich von Choltitz, commander of the German garrison and military governor of Paris, the Germans opened fire on the Grand Palais, an FFI stronghold, and German tanks fired at the barricades in the streets. Adolf Hitler gave the order to inflict maximum damage on the city.\n\nAllied arrival \u2013 24\u201325 August\nThe liberation began when the FFI staged an uprising against the German garrison upon the approach of General Patton's US Third Army. On the night of 24 August, elements of General Philippe Leclerc's 2nd Armored Division made their way into Paris and arrived at the H\u00f4tel de Ville shortly before midnight. The next morning, 25 August, the bulk of the 2nd Armored Division and the US 4th Infantry Division and other allied units entered the city. von Choltitz surrendered to the French at the H\u00f4tel Meurice, the newly established French headquarters. de Gaulle arrived to assume control of the city.\n\nIt is estimated that between 800 and 1,000 Resistance fighters were killed during the Battle for Paris, and another 1,500 were wounded.\n\nGerman surrender \u2013 25 August\n\nDespite repeated orders from Adolf Hitler that the French capital be destroyed before being given up, Choltitz surrendered on 25 August at the H\u00f4tel Meurice. He then signed the official surrender at the Paris Police Prefecture. Choltitz later described himself in Is Paris Burning? (Brennt Paris?) as the saviour of Paris, for not blowing it up before surrendering.\n\nThe same day, Charles , President of the Provisional Government of the French Republic moved back into the War Ministry and made a rousing speech to the crowd from the H\u00f4tel de Ville. The day after 's speech, General Leclerc's 2nd Armored Division paraded down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, while  marched down the boulevard and entered the Place de la Concorde. On 29 August, the U.S. Army's 28th Infantry Division paraded 24-abreast up the Avenue Hoche to the Arc de Triomphe, then down the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es, greeted by joyous crowds.\n\nThe uprising in Paris gave the newly established Free French government and , enough prestige and authority to establish a provisional French Republic, replacing the fallen Vichy regime, which had fled into exile.\n\nSouthern France \u2013 August 1944\n\nPlanning and goals\nWhen first planned, the campaign in southern France and the landings in Normandy were to take place simultaneously\u2014Operation Overlord in Normandy, and \"Anvil\" (as the southern campaign was originally called) in the south of France. A dual landing was soon recognized to be impossible; the southern campaign was postponed. The ports in Normandy had insufficient capacity to handle Allied military supply needs and French generals under  pressed for a direct attack on southern France with the participation of French troops. Despite objections by Churchill, the operation was authorized by the Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff on 14July and scheduled for 15August.\n\nThe goal of the southern France campaign, now known as Operation Dragoon was to secure the vital ports on the French Mediterranean coast (of Marseille and Toulon.) and pressure German forces with another front. The US VI Corps landed on the beaches of the French Riviera () on 15 August 1944 shielded by a large naval task force, followed by several divisions of French Army B (commanded by Jean de Lattre de Tassigny.).\n\nThey were opposed by the scattered forces of the German Army Group G, (HeeresgruppeG) which had been weakened by the relocation of its divisions to other fronts and the replacement of its soldiers with third-rate men outfitted with obsolete equipment. The Army was understrength, most of the units having been sent north earlier. The units that were present were spread thinly, made up of second rate units from eastern Europe (Ostlegionen) with low morale and poor equipment. The coastal defenses had been improved by the Vichy regime and later improved by the Germans after they took over in November 1942.\n\nThe FFI played a major role in the fighting. The Allied ground and naval forces were supported by a fleet of 3470 planes, mostly stationed on Corsica and Sardinia.\n\nOn 14 August, preliminary landings took place in the Hy\u00e8res Islands by the First Special Service Force, a joint U.S.-Canadian special-forces unit, to secure a staging area and for amphibious landing training. After sporadic resistance, driving the German garrison to the western part of the island, the Germans surrendered on 17 August. The Force transferred to the mainland, becoming part of the First Airborne Task Force. Meanwhile, French commandos were active to the west in Operation Romeo and Operation Span.\n\nHindered by Allied air supremacy and a large-scale uprising by the FFI, the weak German forces were swiftly defeated. The Germans withdrew to the north through the Rh\u00f4ne valley, to establish a stable defense line at Dijon. Allied mobile units were able to overtake the Germans and partially block their route at the town of Mont\u00e9limar. The ensuing battle led to a stalemate, with neither side able to achieve a decisive breakthrough, until the Germans were finally able to complete their withdrawal and retreat from the town. While the Germans were retreating, the French managed to capture the important ports of Marseille and Toulon, putting them into operation soon after.\n\nThe Germans were not able to hold Dijon and ordered a complete withdrawal from Southern France. Army GroupG retreated further north, pursued by Allied forces. The fighting ultimately came to a stop at the Vosges mountains, where Army GroupG was finally able to establish a stable defense line. After meeting with the Allied units from Operation Overlord, the Allied forces were in need of reorganizing and, facing stiffened German resistance, the offensive was halted on 14September. Operation Dragoon was considered a success by the Allies. It enabled them to liberate most of Southern France in just four weeks while inflicting heavy casualties on the German forces, although a substantial part of the best German units were able to escape. The captured French ports were put into operation, allowing the Allies to solve their supply problems soon after.\n\nEastern France \u2013 Autumn 1944\n\nThe First Canadian Army liberated the French coast from Normandy to the Low Countries. Hitler had ordered the troops occupying them to hold them at all costs but using isolation and coordinated bombardment, the ports were reduced.\n\nFighting on the Western front seemed to stabilize, and the Allied advance stalled in front of the Siegfried Line (Westwall) and the southern reaches of the Rhine. Starting in early September, the Americans began slow and bloody fighting through the Hurtgen Forest (described by Ernest Hemingway as \"Passchendaele with tree bursts\"\u2014) to breach the Line.\n\nAmerican forces fought from September until mid-December to push the Germans out of Lorraine and from behind the Siegfried Line. The crossing of the Moselle River and the capture of the fortress of Metz proved difficult for the American troops in the face of German reinforcements, supply shortages, and unfavorable weather. During September and October, the Allied 6th Army Group (U.S. Seventh Army and French First Army) fought a difficult campaign through the Vosges Mountains that was marked by dogged German resistance and slow advances. In November, however, the German front snapped under the pressure, resulting in sudden Allied advances that liberated Belfort, Mulhouse, and Strasbourg, and placed Allied forces along the Rhine River. The Germans managed to hold a large bridgehead (the Colmar Pocket), on the western bank of the Rhine and centered around the city of Colmar. On 16 November the Allies started a large scale autumn offensive called Operation Queen. With its main thrust again through the H\u00fcrtgen Forest, the offensive drove the Allies to the Rur River, but failed in its core objectives to capture the Rur dams and pave the way towards the Rhine. The Allied operations were then succeeded by the German Ardennes offensive.\n\nPockets of German resistance \u2013 to May 1945\n\nThe pocket of La Rochelle was a zone of German resistance at the end of the Second World War. It was made up of the city of La Rochelle, the submarine base at La Pallice, of the \u00cele de R\u00e9 and of most of the Ile d'Ol\u00e9ron (the southern part of the island was part of the Royan pocket).\n\nVictory \u2013 7 May 1945\n\nVictory in Europe was achieved on 7 May 1945. Hitler committed suicide on 30 April during the Battle of Berlin and Germany's surrender was authorised by his successor, Reichspr\u00e4sident Karl D\u00f6nitz leader of the rump administration Flensburg Government. The act of military surrender was first signed at 02:41 on 7 May in SHAEF HQ at Reims, and a slightly modified document, considered the definitive German Instrument of Surrender, was signed on 8 May 1945 in Karlshorst, Berlin at 21:20 local time.\n\nAftermath\nBy the autumn of 1944, Paris and the northern part of France were in Allied hands following Normandy campaign, and the southern part of France was free in the wake of the success of Operation Dragoon. Except for a few Atlantic pockets, the Allies were in full control of France, freeing their military forces to push eastward across the Rhine into Germany and towards Berlin.\n\nMeanwhile, liberation of most of metropolitan France unleashed several other overlapping events. The Provisional Government, already in existence since June 1944, moved back to the capital after Paris was liberated in late August, where it piloted an orderly transition back to republican government. The Vichy regime held its last meeting on 17 August 1944, before fleeing into exile in Sigmaringen, Germany.\n\nWithin France, a wave of assaults, extra-judicial executions, and public humiliations followed of suspected collaborators, particularly of women who had consorted with German men. This was known as the  (\"wild purge\"). At least 20,000 French women had their heads shorn. Many women in Normandy reported rapes by American soldiers; several were subsequently executed.\n\nA series of legal purges followed, ordered by courts set up for the purpose. The first free municipal elections since before the war were organized by the Provisional Government in May 1945, and women voted for the first time. The new Constitution of the Fourth French Republic was accepted in October 1946.\n\nEnd of Vichy\n\nUnder pressure from the advancing Allied forces, Pierre Laval held the last government council on 17 August 1944, with five ministers. With permission from the Germans, he attempted to call back the prior National Assembly with the goal of giving it power and thus impeding the communists and . He obtained the agreement of German ambassador Otto Abetz to bring \u00c9douard Herriot, (President of the Chamber of Deputies) back to Paris. But ultra-collaborationists Marcel D\u00e9at and Fernand de Brinon protested to the Germans, who changed their minds and took Laval to Belfort on 20 August 1944 along with the remains of his government, \"to assure its legitimate security\", along with Petain, and arrested Herriot.\n\nA governmental commission directed by Fernand de Brinon was proclaimed on 6 September. On 7 September, they were taken ahead of the advancing Allied Forces out of France to the town of Sigmaringen, where other Vichy officials were already present, arriving on the 8th.\n\nSigmaringen Castle was occupied and used by the Vichy government-in-exile from September 1944 to April 1945. P\u00e9tain resided at the Castle, but refused to cooperate and kept mostly to himself, and ex-Prime Minister Laval also refused. Despite the efforts of the collaborationists and the Germans, P\u00e9tain never recognized the Sigmaringen Commission. The Germans, wanting to present a facade of legality, enlisted other Vichy officials such as Fernand de Brinon as president, along with Joseph Darnand, Jean Luchaire, Eug\u00e8ne Bridoux and Marcel D\u00e9at.\n\nOn 7 September 1944, fleeing the advance of Allied troops into France, a thousand French collaborators (including a hundred officials of the Vichy regime, a few hundred members of the French Militia, collaborationist party militants, and the editorial staff of the newspaper Je suis partout) but also waiting-game opportunists also went into exile in Sigmaringen.\n\nThe commission had its own radio station () and an official press (, Le Petit Parisien), and hosted the embassies of the Axis powers: Germany, Italy and Japan. The population of the enclave was about 6,000, including known collaborationist journalists, the writers Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line and Lucien Rebatet, the actor Robert Le Vigan and their families, as well as 500 soldiers, 700 French SS, prisoners of war and STO workers. Inadequate housing, insufficient food, promiscuity among the paramilitaries, and lack of hygiene facilitated the spread of numerous illnesses including flu and tuberculosis, and a high mortality rate among children. The only two French doctors, Doctor Destouches, alias (Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line) and Bernard M\u00e9n\u00e9trel. treated these ailments as best they could.\n\nOn 21 April 1945 General de Lattre ordered his forces to take Sigmaringen. The end came within days. By the 26th, P\u00e9tain was in the hands of French authorities in Switzerland, and Laval had fled to Spain. Brinon, Luchaire, and Darnand were captured, tried, and executed by 1947. Other members escaped to Italy or Spain.\n\nJustice and retribution\n\nExtrajudicial purges\n\nImmediately following the liberation, France was swept by a wave of executions, public humiliations, assaults and detentions of suspected collaborators, known as the \u00e9puration sauvage (wild purge). This period succeeded the German occupational administration but preceded the authority of the French Provisional Government and consequently lacked any form of institutional justice. Approximately 9,000 were executed, mostly without trial in summary executions, notably including members and leaders of the pro-Nazi milices. In one case, as many as 77 milice members were summarily executed at once. An inquest into the issue of summary executions launched by Jules Moch, then Minister of the Interior, came to the conclusion that there had been 9,673 summary executions. A second inquiry in 1952 separated out 8,867 executions of suspected collaborators and 1,955 summary executions for which the motive of killing was not known, giving a total of 10,822 executions. Shaving the heads of women as a form of humiliation and shaming was a common feature of the purges, and between 10,000 and 30,000 women accused of having collaborated with the Germans or having had relationships with German soldiers or officers were subjected to the practice, becoming known as  ().\n\nLegal purge\n\nThe official \u00e9puration l\u00e9gale (\"legal purge\") began following a June 1944 decree that established a three-tier system of judicial courts: a High Court of Justice which dealt with Vichy ministers and officials; Courts of Justice for other serious cases of alleged collaboration; and regular Civic Courts for lesser cases of alleged collaboration. Over 700 collaborators were executed following legal trials. The initial phase of purge trials ended with a series of amnesty laws passed between 1951 and 1953 which reduced the number of imprisoned collaborators from 40,000 to 62, and was followed by a period of official \"repression\" that lasted between 1954 and 1971.\n\nReliable statistics of the death toll do not exist. At the low end, one estimate is that approximately 10,500 were executed, before and after liberation. \"The courts of Justice pronounced about 6,760 death sentences, 3,910 in absentia and 2,853 in the presence of the accused. Of these 2,853, 73 percent were commuted by , and 767 carried out. In addition, about 770 executions were ordered by the military tribunals. Thus the total number of people executed before and after the Liberation was approximately 10,500, including those killed in the \u00e9puration sauvage\", notably including members and leaders of the milices. US forces put the number of summary executions following liberation at 80,000. The French Minister of the Interior in March 1945 claimed that the number executed was 105,000.\n\nElections of May 1945\n\nThe French municipal elections of 1945 were held in two rounds on 29 April and 13 May 1945. These were the first elections since the liberation of France and the first in which women could vote. Elections did not take place in four departments (Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin, Moselle and Territory of Belfort) with recent fighting that had . In Moselle, they were postponed to 23 and 30 September, at the same time as the cantonal elections, because the end of the fighting was too  These difficulties made it very difficult to compile electoral lists that included women, and there were very few by-elections before these historic dates.\n\nElection context\nWhile the war was not yet officially over (the German surrender of May 8, 1945 was signed between the two rounds of voting), the elections took place in a difficult political and social context: the economic situation remained very precarious, not all prisoners of war had returned, and many scores were being settled in local political life.\n\nThese elections were the first test for the validity of the provisional institutions that had emerged from the Resistance.\n\nThe electoral system in force was the two-round majority system, except in Paris, where elections were held under the proportional system. This election was also marked by the participation of women for the first time in France. On April 21, 1944, the right to vote had been granted to women by the French Committee of National Liberation, and confirmed by the ordinance of October 5 under the Provisional Government of the French Republic. Given the absence of 2 1\/2 million prisoners of war, deportees, STO workers, and the ban on voting by career soldiers, the electorate in this election was composed of up to 62% women (although the figure of 53% is also cited). Despite the novelty of women voters, there was no particular media reaction, partly because of the difficulties related to the immediate post-war period which were of greater concern, such as returned deportees, prisoner camps, food rationing, and so on.\n\nThe referendum proposed to the French by the Provisional Government (GPRF) contained two questions. The first one proposed the drafting of a new Constitution and, consequently, the abandonment of the institutions of the Third Republic. Charles de Gaulle advocated for its support, as did all political parties, excepting the radicals, who remained faithful to the Third Republic. On 21 October 1945, 96 per cent of the French voted \"yes\" on the first question of the referendum in favor of changing the institutions: the Assembly elected that day would thus be constituent.\n\nThe second referendum question concerned the powers of this Constituent Assembly. Fearing a preponderance of communists in control over it, which would allow them to legally install a power of their own choice, General de Gaulle provided a text strictly limiting its prerogatives: its duration was limited to seven months, the constitutional plans it would draft would be submitted to popular referendum, and finally it could only bring down the government by a motion of censure voted by an absolute majority of its members. Most parties supported de Gaulle in advocating a \"yes\" vote, including the Popular Republican Movement (MRP), the socialists and the moderates, while the communists and radicals pushed for \"no\". Nevertheless, 66 per cent of the electorate approved of limiting the powers of the Assembly by voting \"yes\" in the referendum.\n\nProvisional Government of the French Republic\n\nThe Provisional Government of the French Republic was the successor organization to the French Committee of National Liberation. It served as an interim government of Free France between 1944 and 1946, and lasted until the establishment of the Fourth Republic. Its founding marked the official restoration and re-establishment of a provisional French Republic, assuring continuity with the defunct Third Republic which dissolved itself in 1940 with the advent of the Vichy regime.\n\nThe PGFR was created by the Committee of National Liberation on 3 June 1944, the day before  arrived in London from Algiers on Winston Churchill's invitation, and three days before D-day. It moved back to Paris after the liberation of the capital, where its war and foreign policy goals were to secure a French occupation zone in Germany and a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. This was assured through a large military contribution on the western front.\n\nBesides war and foreign policy goals, its principal mission was to prepare the transition to a new constitutional order, that ultimately resulted in the Fourth Republic. It also made several important reforms and political decisions, such as granting women the right to vote, founding the \u00c9cole nationale d'administration, and laying the groundwork of social security in France.\n\nWith regard to transition to a new Republic, the GPRF organized the 1945 French legislative election for 21 October 1945, drew up a Constitution to present to the public for approval, and organized the Constitutional referendum on 13 October 1946 in which it was adopted by the voters, thus bringing into existence the Fourth Republic.\n\nFourth Republic\n\nWith most of the political class discredited and containing many members who had more or less collaborated with Nazi Germany, Gaullism and communism became the most popular political forces in France.\n\nThe Provisional Government (GPRF) ruled from 1944 to 1946, with de Gaulle in charge. Meanwhile, negotiations took place over the proposed new constitution, which was to be put to a referendum. DeGaulle advocated a presidential system of government, and criticized the reinstatement of what he pejoratively called \"the parties system\". He resigned in January 1946 and was replaced by Felix Gouin of the French Section of the Workers' International (socialists; SFIO). Ultimately, only the French Communist Party (PCF) and the socialist SFIO supported the draft constitution, which envisaged a form of government based on unicameralism; but this was rejected in the referendum of 5 May 1946.\n\nFor the 1946 elections, the Rally of Left Republicans (RGR), which encompassed the Radical Party, the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance and other conservative parties, unsuccessfully attempted to oppose the Christian democrat and socialist MRP\u2013SFIO\u2013PCF alliance. The new constituent assembly included 166 MRP deputies, 153 PCF deputies and 128 SFIO deputies, giving the tripartite alliance an absolute majority. Georges Bidault of the MRP replaced Felix Gouin as the head of government.\n\nA new draft of the Constitution was written, which this time proposed the establishment of a bicameral form of government. Leon Blum of the SFIO headed the GPRF from 1946 to 1947. After a new legislative election in June 1946, the Christian democrat Georges Bidault assumed leadership of the Cabinet. Despite DeGaulle's so-called discourse of Bayeux of 16 June 1946 in which he denounced the new institutions, the new draft was approved by 53% of voters voting in favor (with an abstention rate of 31%) in the referendum of 13 October 1946. This culminated in the establishment of the Fourth Republic two weeks later, an arrangement in which executive power essentially resided in the hands of the President of the Council (the prime minister). The President of the Republic was given a largely symbolic role, although he remained chief of the French Army and as a last resort could be called upon to resolve conflicts.\n\nImpact\n\nDemographic\n\nFrance's losses during World War II totaled 600,000 people (1.44% of the population), including 210,000 military deaths from all causes, and 390,000 civilian deaths due to military activity and crimes against humanity. In addition they suffered 390,000 wounded military.\n\nJewish life and society at large had to adjust to a reduced population of French Jews.\nOf the 340,000 Jews living in metropolitan\/continental France in 1940, more than 75,000 were deported to death camps by the Vichy regime, where about 72,500 were killed.\n\nEconomic\n\nFrance emerged from World War II severely weakened economically.  It had been in a period of economic stagnation even when the war broke out.  By 1945 national income, in real terms, was little more than half what it had been in 1929.\n\nTo aid economic recovery, the Chairman of the French Provisional Government, Charles de Gaulle, established the General Planning Commission (Le Commissariat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Plan) on 3 January 1946.  The Commission implemented the Modernization and Re-equipment Plan, commonly known as the Monnet Plan after Jean Monnet, the chief advocate and the first head of the commission.\n\nTo help finance imports of capital equipment and raw materials needed for France's recovery and modernization program, the country negotiated loans from the U.S. and the World Bank in 1946.  Also, from 1948 to 1952, France received just under $3 billion in Marshall Plan aid.\n\nYergin and Stanislaw argue France's post-war Modernization and Re-equipment Plan set it on the road to an \"economic miracle\" in the 1950s.\n\nJudicial\n\nMany leaders and collaborators of the Vichy regime were arrested, and some were imprisoned or sentenced to death. Marshall Petain's death sentence was commuted to life due to his status as a World War I hero. Pierre Laval was tried, and executed by firing squad in October 1945.\n\nSome former collaborators escaped immediate penalties or even continued conventional lives, such as Maurice Papon, who was arrested and convicted in 1998 of crimes against humanity for his role in the deportation of Jews from Bordeaux. German war criminal Klaus Barbie, known as the \"butcher of Lyon\", was extradited from Bolivia in 1983. He was put on trial and sentenced in 1987 to life imprisonment in Lyon.\n\nHistoriographical\nFor decades prior to the 1970s modern period, French historiography was dominated by conservative or pro-Communist thinking, neither of them very inclined to consider the grass-roots pro-democracy developments at liberation.\n\nThere was little recognition in French scholarship on the active participation of the Vichy regime in the deportation of French Jews, until American political scientist Robert Paxton's 1972 book, Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order, 1940\u20131944. The book received a French translation within a year and sold thousands of copies in France. In the words of French historian , the book \"had the effect of a bombshell, because it showed, with supporting evidence, that the French state had participated in the deportation of Jews to the Nazi concentration camps, a fact that had been concealed by historians until then.\"\n\nThe \"Paxtonian revolution\", as the French called it, had a profound effect on French historiography. In 1997, Paxton was called as an expert witness to testify about collaboration during the Vichy period, at the trial in France of Maurice Papon.\n\nSocial and cultural\n\nMany were concerned with getting life back to the way it was, \"a l'identique\", as it was described, but leaders said that modernization was needed. As Jean Monnet said, \"We have no choice. The only alternative to modernization is decadence.\" The question of what this would look like was not obvious, and was one of the core political issues, from liberation to Algerian independence.\n\nThe Second World War had devastated the glittering art and literary effervescence of the\nAnn\u00e9es folles in 1920s Paris, as well as the many Jewish, \u00e9migr\u00e9 and refugee artists and writers who had formed the School of Paris between the two world wars. Marc Chagall escaped to safety in the US with the help of American journalist Varian Fry, but he was one of the lucky, and while he eventually returned to France, he never went back to Paris. The poet Max Jacob on the other hand had died of pneumonia in the camp at Drancy, and Cha\u00efm Soutine died of a bleeding ulcer died while hiding from the Nazis in Paris.\n\nAfter the liberation of France, artists and writers returned, but for the most part they were other artists who made another kind of art. Their themes were no longer color, surrealism and Dada, but mirrored the industrialization of France in their exploration of abstract geometry and the influence of Rothko. Existentialist writers expressed absurdity not as a riot of surrealism but instead as an epistemology of ambiguous moral choices and rejection of outside moral authority.\n\nBut Ernest Hemingway returned with the Allied army and left as a calling card a bucket of hand grenades at the door of Pablo Picasso, who had returned to Paris after the Germans overran his rural refuge; Guernica had made it impossible for him to consider a return to Franco\u2019s Spain. Miles Davis lived in Paris after the war, and so did Norman Mailer and Samuel Beckett, Simone Signoret and Jean Cocteau. Charles de Gaulle appointed Andr\u00e9 Malraux as Minister of Information and then of Cultural Affairs.\n\nPolitical\n\nThe liberation of France had profound effect on the future of French and world politics.\n\nFourth Republic\n\nThe provisional government maintained its position that the Vichy r\u00e9gime had been illegitimate, and therefore considered it a priority to put a Constitutional framework into place. The resulting document full-throatedly reaffirmed the Declaration of the Rights of Man, and affirmed several additional rights, including the right of asylum, of unionization and of freedom of association. As of the very first municipal elections following the liberation of France, women had the right to vote, and from then forward under the Fourth Republic.\n\nThe French Fifth Republic today is built upon the rights expressed in the preface to this document, which it incorporated into its 1958 constitution, and which is still in force today.\n\nCommunist Party\n\nThe trained and disciplined Francs-Tireurs et Partisans brought into play by the Communist International after Hitler invaded Russia both helped to sway the fight and to dispel the previous perception of under the Third Republic of left-wing  politicians as decadent and ineffectual, a disdain that to some extent had underlain the willingness of that government to seek the assistance of the paternalist and traditionalist P\u00e9tain, who had gained the heart of the French by prioritizing the conservation of French forces, following bloodying and bruising casualties in World War 1 on the Eastern front against Germany.\n\nGeopolitics\n\nGiven the important role played by the Big Three in the eventual victory of the Allies, the liberation of France and of Europe led to the geopolitics of the Cold War, and to the decolonization of French and other European former colonies in Africa and elsewhere.\n\nThe creation of the United Nations closely followed the end of World War II. As a successor to the League of Nations whose demise foreshadowed World War II, it did however share some of its flaws, in particular the lack of an army and therefore the means to enforce its charter.\n\nDecolonization\n\nWhile F\u00e9lix \u00c9bou\u00e9 believed that his support of Free France would lead to a new relationship between France and French Africa, the French were initially inclined to dismiss the considerable contribution of African units to the war effort. In fact, on 1 December 1944, gendarmes mowed down a regiment of Tirailleurs Senegalais at the Thiaroye camp for complaining of poor conditions and demanding their back pay.\n\nMorocco and Tunisia, which were French protectorates in World War II, and with the exception of Casablanca, played a more limited role in the war, primarily in the Western Desert campaign, were able to negotiate their independence from France relatively quickly. Algeria, however, which had since 1848 been considered an integral part of France, and had a sizeable population of French settlers, suffered through an extensive and bloody war of independence.\n\nA series of events beginning 8 May 1945, the same day that Nazi Germany surrendered, triggered growing demand for independence. About 5,000 Muslims paraded in S\u00e9tif, a market town west of Constantine, to celebrate the victory. The local French gendarmerie tried to seize banners attacking colonial rule and rioting broke out. The ensuing indiscriminate French reprisals sparked further denunciations of colonial rule.\n\nSee also\n\n 1940 in France\n 1941 in France\n 1942 in France\n 1943 in France\n 1944 in France\n 1945 in France\n Foreign policy of Charles de Gaulle\n France\u2013Germany border\n French Liberation Army\n Liberation of Europe\n Military history of France during World War II\n Post\u2013World War II economic expansion\n Rene Bousquet\n Royal Air Forces Escaping Society\n SOE F Section networks\n Timeline of the Battle of France\n Timeline of the liberation of France\n 20th-century French art\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nWorks cited\n \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n  \n \n   \n   -->\n\nFurther reading\n Aron, Robert.

The album features guest appearances from JID, Charlie Wilson, Young Thug, Slowthai, Vince Staples, Summer Walker, and Injury Reserve.\n\nPrior to release, Limbo was promoted by three singles: \"Shimmy\", \"Riri\", and \"Compensating\". The album debuted at number 16 on the US Billboard 200 chart, earning 26,000 album-equivalent units in its first week.\n\nPromotion\nThe album's lead single, \"Shimmy\", was released alongside its music video on February 26, 2020. The video depicts Amin\u00e9 performing the song at various locales in his hometown of Portland, Oregon. \"Riri\" was released on May 29, 2020, and its music video was released June 24, 2020, after being delayed so Amin\u00e9 could participate in Black Lives Matter marches in protest against the murder of George Floyd and shooting of Breonna Taylor. \"Compensating\" featuring Young Thug, was released on July 6, 2020, as the album's third single.\n\nCritical reception\n\nLimbo was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 75, based on seven reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 6.7 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.\n\nSheldon Pearce of Pitchfork highlighted Amin\u00e9's shift in style from his previous album, stating \"he's more pragmatic, suddenly concerned with crafting a sustainable legacy, and this new attitude produces the best music of his career\". Writing for Slant Magazine, Charles Lyons-Burt praised Amin\u00e9's performance and wrote \"In melding traditional hip-hop form with just the right amount of modern trap verve, Limbo makes the case for Amin\u00e9, if not as the next great rapper, then as a pop-rap workhorse. The album proves that he can keep pace with his contemporaries while drawing on the history of the genre in ways many of today's innovators are unconcerned with engaging\". Candace McDuffie of Paste said, \"Although this light-hearted nature dominated Good for You in its entirety, Limbo takes more of an existential turn as Amin\u00e9 earnestly wonders what comes after that initial rush of success\". Nicolas-Tyrell Scott from Crack Magazine enjoyed the album, saying, \"Limbo feels like the emergence of a new artist: one whose growth has taught him exactly how to use his voice\". Steve \"Flash\" Juon of RapReviews said, \"Limbo shows that if he takes his time and works with the right people, the results can be drastically improved. The hidden talent Amine had is hidden no more, and I'm happy to say I won't be nearly so reluctant to listen to his NEXT album\".\n\nThe album also received some mixed reviews. Mike Milenko of Clash described the album as \"an example of a talented artist not pushing his boundaries\". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Eli Enis praised the first six tracks before noting \"the record falls off during its latter half as the melodic R&B cuts begin to blend together\".\n\nYear-end lists\n\nCommercial performance\nLimbo debuted at number 16 on the US Billboard 200 chart, earning 26,000 album-equivalent units in its first week.

{"eng_Latn":"Martino da Canal was a 13th-century Venetian chronicler, whose only known work is the so-called Les estoires de Venise, a French chronicle of the history of Venice from its beginnings to 1275. It is particularly valuable for Canal's depiction of events during his own lifetime, particularly during the years 1267\u20131275, when he was at Venice.\n\nBiography\nMartino da Canal is not mentioned in any other source, and the only biographical information about him is what can be extracted from his work. His date of birth and early life are entirely unknown. He was obviously familiar with Venice and its history, and certainly resided in the city itself between 1267 and 1275, when he composed his chronicle, as his account of these years is obviously that of an eyewitness. It is possible that he was a minor public official, perhaps a scribe, on some Venetian board or magistrature, with the Tavola da Mar, a sort of maritime customs, the most likely candidate. He may have had some close relationship with the Doge Reniero Zeno, to whom an extensive portion of his work is dedicated, including events before his election to the dogate. The chronicle ends on September 1275, which is also the last date attested for his life.\n\nChronicle\nHis sole known work was a chronicle of the Republic of Venice, from the city's foundation to 1275. Written in French, Canal titled it Cronique des Veniciens (\"Chronicle of the Venetians\"), but it is more commonly known under the title Les estoires de Venise. The work is divided into two parts of more or less equal length, each with its own prologue. The first part of the work was written in 1267\u20131268, and was stopped after recounting the downfall of the Romano family in 1259, possibly due to the death of Zeno. The second part of the work is more disjoined, and include two sections dedicated to the festivals of Venice and the parade in honour of Zeno's successor, Lorenzo Tiepolo.\n\nAs his work is skewed towards events contemporary with his own life, Canal is certainly not a disinterested observer of remote events, but a partisan with a very clear, patriotic viewpoint. He defends the actions of the Venetians during and after the Fourth Crusade, trying to dispel the accusation that they had diverted it to Constantinople for their own benefit. Domestically he appears a champion of order and the state's institutions, and supports the reconciliation of classes, particularly in the aftermath of the adverse impact on the Venetian economy of the reconquest of Constantinople by the Byzantines in 1261.\n\nCanal reused older sources for the early potions of his chronicle, but these are difficult to identify. He did include several original documents, however, such as the Partitio Romaniae of 1204 and a 1125 charter by Baldwin II of Jerusalem. His particular value lies in the events he himself witnessed, starting with the dogate of Jacopo Tiepolo. The chronicle was known and relied on by the author of the unpublished early 14th-century chronicle of Marco, as well as by the Doge and chronicler Andrea Dandolo, who used it rather selectively in his compilation of Venetian history. There is also some evidence that the 18th-century writer Giustiniana Wynne knew of the work, but otherwise it appears to have been buried in the commercial archives and not discovered again until the 19th century, when L. F. Polidori published its first edition in 1845. Its modern editions are by Alberto Limentani, Les Estoires de Venise: Cronaca veneziana in lingua francese dalle origini al 1275 (Florence 1972), and an English translation by Laura K.

{"eng_Latn":"Trump v. Vance, 591 U.S. ___ (2020), was a landmark US Supreme Court case arising from a subpoena issued in August 2019 by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. against Mazars, then-President Donald Trump's accounting firm, for Trump's tax records and related documents, as part of his ongoing investigation into the Stormy Daniels scandal. Trump commenced legal proceedings to prevent their release.\n\nThe Court held that Article II and the Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution do not categorically preclude or require a heightened standard for the issuance of a state criminal subpoena to a sitting president. The 7\u20132 decision was issued in July 2020, with Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissenting.\n\nBackground\n\nAfter Donald Trump indicated his intent to run for US president as a Republican candidate, he was called upon to release his income tax returns in the public interest, as most other presidential candidates did. Trump had stated in his campaign that he would release them once they had been \"worked on.\"  After his election victory and taking office in 2017, Trump refused to give over his tax records and stated that voters were not interested in them.\n\nThe Democratic Party gained control of the US House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections, and by April 2019, the House Ways and Means Committee had formally requested from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) six years of Trump's returns, a power vested in Congress under . The IRS failed to comply with the request. Both the Ways and Means Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Reform filed subpoenas to Mazars, Trump's accounting firm, to obtain the tax information. The Trump administration refused to comply with the subpoenas and asserted that they lacked \"a legitimate legislative purpose.\" However, those subpoenas were directed at Mazars and later at Deutsche Bank and Capital One, where Trump had accounts, and those entities had indicated they would comply with the subpoenas. Trump then tried to block the subpoenas, which led to two separate suits, Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP and Trump et al. v. Deutsche Bank AG, which were consolidated under the Trump v. Mazars suit by the Supreme Court in its 2019 term.\n\nDistrict Court \nSeparately, as part of the city's ongoing criminal investigation into the Stormy Daniels scandal, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. in August 2019 subpoenaed Mazars for Trump's tax returns. Trump filed suit against the district attorney and Mazars in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York to block the subpoena arguing that a sitting president enjoys \"absolute immunity from criminal process of any kind.\"\n\nProsecutors countered that Trump had \"sweeping immunity\" from a criminal probe while he was in office and that Trump was \"seeking to invent and enforce a new presidential 'tax return privilege,' on the theory that disclosing information in a tax return will necessarily reveal information that will somehow impede the functioning of a President, sufficiently to meet the test of irreparable harm.\"\n\nThe District Court dismissed the case on the basis of Younger v. Harris (1971), which had stated federal courts should abstain in the matters of tort claims being brought by the person who was prosecuted by those claims. As such, the District Court ordered Trump to comply with the subpoena, pending a ruling from the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n\nSecond Circuit \nThe Second Circuit panel ruled unanimously against Trump in November 2019. The decision stated that the president is not immune from \"the enforcement of a state grand jury subpoena directing a third party to produce non-privileged material, even when the subject matter under investigation pertains to the President\" and that a state grand jury may issue subpoenas \"in aid of its investigation of potential crimes committed by persons within its jurisdiction, even if that investigation may in some way implicate the President.\"\n\nSupreme Court\nTrump petitioned to the US Supreme Court on the Second Circuit's ruling to the New York district attorney subpoena as well as in the separate cases related to the House Committee subpoenas. The Supreme Court certified all three cases in December 2019 by consolidating the two House Committee cases into Trump v. Mazars and handling the New York case under Trump v. Vance separately.\n\nOral arguments were held on May 12, 2020, alongside the Trump v. Mazars arguments, both as part of the set of cases held through teleconference because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Observers recognized that the Justices treated Vance, which involved a subpoena related to a grand jury criminal investigation, and Mazars, involving subpoenas related to a Congressional investigation, very differently and expected there to be different results between the cases, with Vance likely to favor the release of the tax records. Justices also spoke of possibly sending both cases to the lower courts with a set of standards to evaluate the subpoena requests.\n\nMajority opinion\nThe Court released its decision on July 9, 2020, by affirming the decision of the Second Circuit and remanding the case for continued review. The 7\u20132 decision affirmed that absolute immunity to the president is not granted by the Supremacy Clause or Article II of the Constitution. Through those principles, the Court also held that the president enjoys no absolute immunity from state criminal subpoenas directed at his private papers and that he is not entitled to a heightened standard for the issuance of such a subpoena. Instead, the president can rely on the defenses that are available to everyone else like overbreadth and unwarranted harassment. In remanding the case to the District Court, the Court's order stated that \"the President may raise further arguments as appropriate\" to challenge the subpoena. In evaluating those arguments judges should be \"meticulous\" according to the Court, but \"this does not mean they should use a stricter standard in evaluating them.\"\n\nThe majority opinion was written by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Roberts wrote that former Chief Justice John Marshall established the principle 200 years earlier that no citizen, including the president, may escape the common duty to produce evidence when he is called upon during a criminal proceeding.  Roberts wrote, \"In our judicial system, 'the public has a right to every man's evidence'. Since the earliest days of the Republic, 'every man' has included the President of the United States.\"\n\nConcurring opinion\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a concurring opinion joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch. Kavanaugh wrote that he would have held the case to the standard established in United States v. Nixon, which determined that a prosecutor must have a \"demonstrated, specific need\" for subpoenaing a President. Otherwise, Kavanaugh agreed with the judgement and added that the Court \"unanimously agrees that this case should be remanded to the District Court, where the President may raise constitutional and legal objections to the subpoena as appropriate.\"\n\nDissenting opinions\nJustices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito wrote separate dissenting opinions.\n\nThomas wrote that the majority opinion, which allowed subpoenas to be placed against the president, created an undue burden: \"the demands on the president's time and the importance of his tasks are extraordinary, and the office of the president cannot be delegated to subordinates. A subpoena imposes both demands on the president's limited time and a mental burden, even when the president is not directly engaged in complying.\"\n\nAlito wrote on his concern that the majority opinion would open the president to potential action from over 2000 local prosecutors and would impair the functionality of the presidential office: \"Respect for the structure of government created by the Constitution demands greater protection for an institution that is vital to the nation's safety and well-being.\"\n\nPost-judgement\nOn the same day, the Trump v. Mazars case was remanded to the lower court by the Supreme Court with the same 7\u20132 split. Congress has the authority to subpoena the president as part of its legislative duties, but the Supreme Court found a stronger requirement to exist for the congressional subpoena than for a state grand jury subpoena. Chief Justice Roberts gave the lower courts a list of four considerations to determine when a congressional subpoena is appropriate within the scope of the separation of powers.\n\nAt the request of Vance, the Supreme Court on July 17, 2020 allowed the judgment from its ruling to take effect immediately, instead of the 25 days after decision normally established, to allow the district attorney's office to proceed to request documents while the judicial arguments continued.\n\nRemand to District Court\nOn the remand of Trump v. Vance to the Southern New York District Court, Judge Victor Marrero set a deadline of July 15, 2020, for Trump to provide additional objections to the subpoena. Trump\u2019s revised complaint asserted that Vance's subpoena was politically motivated and overly broad. Marrero declined to block the subpoena on August 20, 2020, saying that Trump's new complaint was not substantially different from the first and dismissed Trump's case with prejudice, which allowed the subpoena to be executed. He concluded: \"Justice requires an end to this controversy.\"\n\nAppeal to Federal Court\nOn the next day, August 21, Trump's lawyers filed an emergency request with a federal appeals court to put the subpoena on hold, but the court denied his request that same day. Instead, the court granted him a hearing that was scheduled for September 1, but meanwhile, the subpoena remained in force. Trump's accounting records could have been given to the New York State grand jury before the hearing took place, but that did not happen. The appeals court ruled unanimously on October 7, 2020, to deny Trump's objection and ordered the subpoena to be obeyed.\n\nAppeal to Supreme Court\nTrump had stated his intent to appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court and was granted 12 days in which to do so and prosecutors delayed execution of the subpoena. On October 13, 2020, Trump submitted a petition to the Supreme Court for a stay pending its review of the appeals court decision.\n\nOn February 22, 2021, the Supreme Court denied the stay request, clearing the path for Trump\u2019s tax records as well as other records to be released to prosecutors for review by a grand jury.\n\nDisclosure of records\nWithin hours of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, Mazars handed over to Vance millions of pages of documents containing Trump's tax returns from January 2011 to August 2019, as well as financial statements, engagement agreements, documents relating to the preparation and review of tax returns, and work papers and communications related to the tax returns.\n\nOn February 23, 2021, the House Oversight and Reform Committee in the 117th Congress, reissued its subpoena to Mazars seeking the same documents as had been provided to Vance, and which it had previously sought and been unable to obtain in Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP.\n\nSee also \n Clinton v. Jones\n Doe et al. v.

{"eng_Latn":"Andrew (II) from the kindred Hont-P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny (; died 1299) was a Hungarian medieval soldier in the second half of the 13th century. He was the progenitor of the influential Forg\u00e1ch family.\n\nFamily\nAndrew (II) was born into the Forg\u00e1cs branch of the wealthy and prestigious gens (clan) Hont-P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny. His father was Andrew (I), a faithful confidant of King B\u00e9la IV. His mother was Maria N\u00e1nabeszter. Andrew had several siblings, John and Thomas (III) entered ecclesiastical and court career, respectively, while the younger brothers \u2013 Iv\u00e1nka (III) and Nicholas (I) supported their political orientation with military service. They also had two sisters, including Yolanda.\n\nAndrew had two sons from the marriage with his unidentified wife: Nicholas (II) and Andrew (III). Nicholas became the first member of the Forg\u00e1ch noble family, which adopted his nickname (\"Forg\u00e1cs\") and flourished until the 20th century. Surviving branches still exists today. The other son, Andrew (III) also had two sons, Nicholas (III) and John \"the Sharp\", but they died before the end of the 14th century without known issues.\n\nMilitary service\nAndrew served Ladislaus IV of Hungary faithfully as a courtly knight. For instance, he participated in the Battle on the Marchfeld in 1278. For his service, he was granted the villages of Vajk (present-day L\u00fa\u010dnica nad \u017ditavou, Slovakia) and Herest\u00e9ny by Ladislaus in March 1287.\n\nWhen Andrew III of Hungary ascended the Hungarian throne in 1290, the Hont-P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny clan \u2013 including Andrew and his brothers \u2013 became one of the strongest pillars of his reign, which was characterized by constant rebellions against the royal authority. Andrew functioned as vice-isp\u00e1n of \u00c1rva () in 1291, which then belonged to the royal forest of Z\u00f3lyom. This is the first mention of an existing administrative division called \u00c1rva, which later became a separate county after the disintegration of the extensive Z\u00f3lyom by the mid-14th century. The Hont-P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny brothers jointly owned the lordship of G\u00edmes Castle (near present-day Jelenec, Slovakia) and the surrounding landholdings and villages in Nyitra and Bars counties. The four brothers \u2013 Thomas, Andrew, Iv\u00e1nka and Nicholas \u2013 divided the lordship of G\u00edmes among themselves in January 1295.\n\nThese lands became important, when the neighboring powerful lord Matthew Cs\u00e1k, who possessed and ruled contiguous lands in the north-western counties, turned against Andrew at the end of 1297. The younger brothers Andrew, Iv\u00e1nka and Nicholas picked fight against the rebellious baron, also representing the monarch's interests, who excused them from all the damage caused to the Cs\u00e1k brothers, Matthew and Cs\u00e1k, and their familiares. After a one-year effective ceasefire, the conflict has recurred between Andrew III and Matthew Cs\u00e1k by the second half of 1299. Following a failed royal campaign led by Demetrius Balassa against the Cs\u00e1k territory, the oligarch's troops invaded the central parts of Upper Hungary. According to a later 14th-century source, Andrew and Iv\u00e1nka were killed in the skirmish.\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n\n \n \n \n\n1299 deaths\n13th-century Hungarian people\nAndrew 02\nMedieval Hungarian soldiers\nHungarian military personnel killed in action"}
{"eng_Latn":"From This Pen is a compilation album by American country music singer-songwriter Bill Anderson. It was released in June 1965 via Decca Records in several sessions produced by Owen Bradley. It was Anderson's second compilation released during his career and contained songs that he had recorded since his signing with the label. Many of the songs featured were major hits for Anderson in preceding years.\n\nBackground, release and reception\n\nFrom This Pen was Anderson's first compilation (and album overall) to feature entirely self-composed material. The album's title was derived from this idea. Although many of these songs were recorded by other artists, Anderson also cut them. This occurred in a series of sessions that took place in his early years at Decca (between 1958 and 1965). All of the sessions were produced by Anderson's long-time studio producer, Owen Bradley. The recording sessions were held at both the Bradley Studio and the Columbia Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. The album contained a total of 13 tracks. This included the lead track, which served as a spoken introduction to the album. Only two tracks were co-written with other songwriters. The remaining tracks were entirely self-composed. Several of these compositions were pitched to other country artists and became major hits during this time. These former hits include Connie Smith's \"Once a Day,\" Lefty Frizzell's \"Saginaw, Michigan,\" Ray Price's \"City Lights\" and Charlie Louvin's \"I Don't Love You Anymore.\"\n\nFrom This Pen was released in June 1965 on the Decca label. It was Anderson's second compilation released in his music career. The record was issued as a vinyl LP, containing seven track on side one and six tracks on side two. From This Pen spent 14 weeks on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and peaked at number seven in October 1965. It became Anderson's third album to chart on the Billboard country albums survey. From This Pen received positive reception from Allmusic, who rated the record three out of five stars.\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs composed by Bill Anderson, except where noted.\n\nPersonnel\nAll credits are adapted from the liner notes of From This Pen.\n\nMusical personnel\n Bill Anderson \u2013 lead vocals\n Harold Bradley \u2013 banjo, guitar\n Floyd Cramer \u2013 piano, vibes\n Jimmy Day \u2013 steel guitar\n Pete Drake \u2013 steel guitar\n Buddy Emmons \u2013 steel guitar\n Buddy Harman \u2013 drums\n Tommy Jackson \u2013 fiddle\n Bob Moore \u2013 bass\n Morris Palmer \u2013 drums\n Jimmy Riddle \u2013 harmonica\n The Anita Kerr Singers \u2013 background vocals\n Joe Zinkan \u2013 bass\n\nTechnical personnel\n Owen Bradley \u2013 producer\n\nChart performance\n\nRelease history\n\nReferences\n\n1965 albums\nAlbums produced by Owen Bradley\nBill Anderson (singer) compilation albums\nDecca Records albums"}

{"eng_Latn":"\"Stolen\" is the tenth episode of the seventh season of the American television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D., it follows a Life Model Decoy of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they race to stop the unraveling of history in the 1980s. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledges the franchise's films. The episode was written by George Kitson and Mark Leitner, from a story by Mark Linehan Bruner, and directed by Garry A. Brown.\n\nClark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, starring alongside Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward.\n\n\"Stolen\" originally aired on ABC on July 29, 2020, and was watched by 1.30 million viewers.\n\nPlot\nStranded in 1983 due to a malfunctioning time drive, the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents plan to restore order to the timeline by defeating Nathaniel Malick and rescuing the Inhumans he has taken prisoner at the sanctuary, Afterlife. Noting that Agent Daisy Johnson could be erased from history if her mother, Jiaying, were to be killed, Director Alphonso \"Mack\" Mackenzie instead sends LMD Phil Coulson into the facility with the teleporting Inhuman Gordon while he and Agent Elena \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez provide back-up. Meanwhile, Johnson learns from Melinda May that she had a sister named Kora, who committed suicide in the original timeline before she was born, but who has been rescued by Malick and turned into one of his acolytes in this version of events.\n\nAt Afterlife, Malick uses the Chronicom Time Stream to look into the future. Using this knowledge, he recruits a young John Garrett and shows him his future wherein he betrays S.H.I.E.L.D. to join Hydra and Coulson kills him. Upon their arrival, Coulson and Gordon are captured, before Malick transfers the latter's powers to Garrett. Imprisoned with Coulson, Gordon teleports the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent to freedom, dying in the process. When Coulson fails to make contact, Mack and Yo-Yo enter Afterlife and free the captured Inhumans and Coulson, who tranquilizes Kora on his way out, before bringing them all to their headquarters, the Lighthouse.\n\nMeanwhile, Daniel Sousa convinces Johnson to speak with her mother, helping to reconcile the pair after Jiaying's death in the present during the main timeline. Malick and Garrett teleport into the Lighthouse, where the former, using the abilities he took from her in 1976, knocks Johnson to the ground and kills Jiaying before escaping. Garrett kidnaps Jemma Simmons and takes her and Malick onto S.H.I.E.L.D.'s mobile headquarters, Zephyr One, and Malick and Garrett hijack it, with Deke Shaw unknowingly trapped inside the engineering bay. After heading into space and out of range of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s satellites, Malick notes to a captured Simmons that every version of events where he does not win the battle with S.H.I.E.L.D. occurs because of her husband Leo Fitz, and demands she reveal his location.\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\nAfter the sixth season finale of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. aired in August 2019, showrunners Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell revealed that the seventh season would feature the team trying to save the world from invasion by the Chronicoms. They use time travel to do this, allowing the season to explore the history of S.H.I.E.L.D. Later that month, one of the season's episodes was revealed to be titled \"Stolen\" and written by George Kitson and Mark Leitner from a story by Mark Linehan Bruner. It was confirmed to be the tenth episode of the season in July 2020, when Garry A. Brown was revealed to have directed it. Bruner was Bell's assistant at the start of the season, and was scheduled to be the writer of the episode as a freelancer. However, after starting the outline of the script, he was hired as a staff writer on Legends of Tomorrow, resulting in Kitson and Leitner taking over writing duties. After completing the script before production began, Leitner also left as he was hired on another series as well.\n\nCasting\n\nWith the season renewal, main cast members Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward were confirmed to be returning from previous seasons as Melinda May, Daisy Johnson \/ Quake, Jemma Simmons, Alphonso \"Mack\" Mackenzie, Elena \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez, and Deke Shaw, respectively. Series star Clark Gregg also returns as his character Phil Coulson, portraying a Life Model Decoy version of the character.\n\nIn July 2020, Gregg discussed actors that he wished could return for the seventh season, including Bill Paxton who portrayed John Garrett in the series' first season before his death in February 2017. Gregg said it would be \"really amazing if there was some way to feel like we had the spirit of Bill Paxton with us\" and teased that could happen in the season. Later that month, Paxton's son James was revealed to be guest starring in \"Stolen\" as a younger version of John Garrett. James Paxton rewatched all of his father's episodes from earlier in the season to prepare, learning the cadence Bill used when speaking his lines. James felt he could increase the character's energy and excitement in certain moments, because the younger version was \"probably even more of a hothead and excitable at that age\".\n\nOther guest stars appearing alongside Paxton include: Enver Gjokaj reprising his Agent Carter role as agent Daniel Sousa, Dichen Lachman as Jiaying, Thomas E. Sullivan as Nathaniel Malick, Dianne Doan as Kora, Tipper Newton as Roxy Glass, and Byron Mann as Li. All return from earlier in the season. Fin Argus also returns as a young Gordon.\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins\nShaw listens to a cassette of Deke Squad Mix Vol. 2 on a Walkman, a reference to Star-Lord from Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). Meagan Damore from Comic Book Resources noted the Walkman reference was \"a tongue-in-cheek nod to the fans who once speculated that Deke was Star-Lord\"; when Shaw first appeared in season five, he wore a helmet similar to Star-Lord's mask.\n\nRelease\n\"Stolen\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on July 29, 2020.\n\nReception\n\nRatings\nIn the United States the episode received a 0.3 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 0.3 percent of all households in that demographic. It was watched by 1.30 million viewers. Within a week of release, \"Stolen\" was watched by 2.32 million viewers.\n\nCritical response\nThe A.V. Clubs Alex McLevy gave the episode a \"B\", stating the episode had \"a strong script, fleet pacing, and some especially good character dynamics from Daisy, Simmons, and Coulson\". He noted \"the heart of the episode\" was Daisy's interaction with Jiaying. McLevy added the show \"could stand to do a little more with\" Malick having the Timestream, as there was the potential \"to really stack the deck against S.H.I.E.L.D. in these last few episodes.\" Writing for Den of Geek, Michael Ahr felt the best moments of the episode were between Daisy and Jiaying, and enjoyed the twist of Malick searching for Simmons. Ahr also enjoyed Daisy going \"into god mode\" and the frightened look on Malick's face \"was priceless\". He concluded that the \"story possibilities are thankfully starting to open up for [the series'] final three episodes\", giving the episode 4 stars out of 5. Awarding the episode a \"B\", Wesley Coburn of Bam! Smack! Pow! felt the episode \"started slowly, but ramped up the action quotient and tension steadily while beginning to shift the characters into their places for the series finale.\"\n\nSyfy Wires Trent Moore felt including John Garrett into the season helped turn the \"greatest hits\" approach to the season \"into one heck of a ride\". He said, \"Ending the series with this time travel adventure has been such an effective way to play in the sandbox this show has spent six amazing years creating. Let's just sit back and enjoy the ride.\" Jamie Jirak from ComicBook.com felt James Paxton \"could not have done a better job embodying his father\" in the episode, adding he \"perfectly captur[ed] the sly charm that made Garrett so much fun\". Ahr also thought Paxton did a \"spot-on impression\" of his father, while Coburn called Paxton's mannerisms \"spot-on\".\n\nChristian Houlb of Entertainment Weekly was more critical of the episode, calling it \"really lame\" and was \"disappointed at the level of weak sauce Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is supplying us in its final episodes.\" Houlb called Nathaniel Malick \"really annoying\" and did not have enough good qualities to justify being the primary villain of the final season, but compared to John Garrett, Malick was \"a magnetic and compelling supervillain\". Garrett for Houlb was \"awful\" given his \"unbearable\" dialogue that he was screaming \"in the screechiest possible voice\". Giving the episode a \"C\u2212\", he concluded the series was \"running on fumes\" at this point. The other reviewers also took issue with Nathaniel Malick as the season's villain. McLevy felt either Thomas E. Sullivan's performance or how the show has not established the character as a threat resulted in a lack of \"imposing malevolence necessary to make this showdown as monumental as it wants to be... It feels like a step down from the Chronicom plot we've been dealing with\". Ahr called him \"not a great Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. villain\" as his love of anarchy \"comes across as a very bland flavor of evil\" and knowing the future \"gives him an advantage that he doesn't deserve, making his position of power in the narrative feel very much unearned.\"\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \"Stolen\" at ABC\n \n\n2020 American television episodes\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

{"eng_Latn":"Tyler Ronan is a fictional character and the co-protagonist of the 2020 episodic narrative adventure game Tell Me Why, a three-part narrative video game developed by Dontnod Entertainment and published by Xbox Game Studios in 2020. Tell Me Why follows Tyler and his twin sister Alyson as they revisit their childhood home following a long separation. The game's narrative moves between the past and present, as the twins utilize their supernatural telepathic bond to explore memories of their past, some of it repressed, in an attempt to piece together the details of the tragic event that irrevocably impact both of their lives. Tyler Ronan is voiced by American actor August Aiden Black, who is a trans man like the character he portrays.\n\nTyler's status as the first transgender character to star in a AAA video game for a major developmental studio received significant media coverage prior to and after the release of Tell Me Why. The character's critical reception has been positive, with Black praised for his voice acting. At the 2021 Gayming Awards, Tyler was named Best LGBTQ Character, while Tell Me Why was conferred the Authentic Representation Award for its depiction of LGBT characters like Tyler.\n\nDevelopment\n\nConcept and creation\nTell Me Why was announced during Microsoft's Xbox London event on November 14, 2019, with Dontnod Entertainment revealing that one of its main characters is a transgender individual. The studio wanted to ensure that Tyler's experience is grounded in authenticity, not only shunning stereotypes and tropes about transgender people, but also that the character is not solely defined by his gender and trauma. Clay Carmouche, narrative director with Xbox Publishing, noted that stories which focus on marginalized characters are infrequently told, and that there is much scrutiny surrounding these stories as there is a \"legacy of bad representation\" which is prevalent in video game industry. In anticipation of mistrust or pessimism that the portrayals of characters like Tyler may be insincere or unempathetic, Carmouche pointed out that a frequently asked questions (FAQ) page is available on the official website of Tell Me Why to address such concerns as well as clarifying the direction of the narrative as determined by its developers.\n\nAccording to game director Florent Guillaume, Tyler being a trans man resonates to the essence of Tell Me Why given the nature of its story and the themes it explores. Guillaume explained that the developers believed in the force of their story, and understand the risks as well as the responsibility it would mean to create a character who is believable and realistic. To him, authentic representation is crucial due to the fact that storytelling in video games often place players from the perspective of characters they may not necessarily relate to, which presents a \"unique opportunity to drive empathy and share experiences\u201d. Guillaume explains that Tell Me Why avoids a common trope in fictional works where minority characters are often painted in \"broad strokes\", and emphasized that while it is not possible for the developers to represent every transgender individual's experience within the constraints of the game's narrative, he hoped that players will be moved by Tyler's individual story. While Tell Me Why is the first AAA video game to feature a transgender character as its main character, Guillaume drew attention to the fact that many indie video games have featured LGBTQ+ themes or openly transgender characters, and he was hopeful that other major developmental studios do not hesitate to follow in their examples.\n\nDontnod consulted GLAAD, a non-governmental organization (NGO) originally founded to monitor potentially defamatory media coverage and depictions of LGBT people, for advice and input in the development of Tyler as an authentic transgender character. Guillaume credited GLAAD, particularly its director of transgender representation Nick Adams, for their assistance into script reviews and casting for Tyler, as well as its efforts in LGBTQ+ community outreach. Adams said that it is important that Tyler is a \"realistic hero\" and that Tell Me Why fosters an inclusive gaming experience, as \"authentic media portrayals of trans characters can be a powerful tool for acceptance and understanding\". Adams explained that it is critical that the real story of Tell Me Why does not place undue emphasis on the thoughts and opinions expressed by other characters towards Tyler's gender identity;  instead, the goal is to strike \"a balance between not ignoring Tyler\u2019s \u2018transness\u2019, as if it doesn't affect his life, but not making it the central focus\".\n\nPlayers may decide during the course of the narrative as to whether Tyler develops a romantic relationship with Michael, Alyson's friend and colleague at the local caf\u00e9 and convenience store in Delos Crossing. \nCarmouche noted that Adams wanted the writing team to explore Tyler's romantic side. The developers decided to approach the romantic dialogue between Tyler and Michael in a manner that players may experience the romantic content at their choosing, as opposed to defining Tyler with a specific sexual orientation. Tyler is occasionally referred to as \"Ollie\" during explorations of the character's pre-transition past: it is the first name or alias Tyler chose for himself.\n\nPortrayal\nAugust Aiden Black, who voiced Tyler, was described by Guillaume in an interview as more than the Tyler's voice actor as he was essentially \"a vital member of the creative team.\u201d Black acknowledged that Tyler is a personal role for him and that he drew from a lot of his own experiences during the development process, which influenced his portrayal of the character. Black described Tyler's \"battle with acceptance in his personal relationships and community is something a lot of the LGBT+ community goes through\", including himself, and that these experiences in turn shape how many transgender people approach life in reality. Black explained that Tyler's transgender identity is important as it \"brings value to the story\" of Tell Me Why, and that the game provides a highly visible platform to showcase a common shared life experience for transgender people which not many people are exposed to.\n\nOn Tyler's potential cultural significance, Black that he is \"so much more than just a trans character\", as his gender transitioning experiences is only part of a full fleshed out personality. Black suggested that as a member of a minority group, \"having a video game character that might look like you is great\", but it is more important that youthful players from that minority group could relate to characters who feel like they do, and provides \"a connection they might not have anywhere else\". Black is hopeful that characters like Tyler as presented in Tell Me Why will prove to be a watershed moment, and that more \"characters meant to challenge the norms\u201d will emerge in the future.\n\nFictional biography\nIn Tell Me Why, Tyler reunites with his twin sister Alyson outside a youth detention center and revisit their childhood home in Delos Crossing. The twins were very close to each other as children due to their supernatural telepathic bond. After Alyson stabbed her mother Mary-Ann with a pair of scissors she used to cut her sibling's hair and inadvertently sent her plunging to her death from the side of their house's pier, Tyler insisted on taking the fall to protect her, and was subsequently sent to a juvenile detention center while Alyson is adopted by the incident's investigating officer, Delos police chief Eddy Brown. As a result of the incident, Tyler had long believed that Mary-Ann was transphobic and chased him with a double-barreled shotgun onto the pier after suffering a psychotic break.\n\nFollowing Tyler's return to Delos Crossing, certain residents who knew him prior to his gender transition occasionally react in an offensive manner. For example, Mary-Ann's confidante Sam expresses astonishment that Tyler could look so much \"like a man\". As they explore the house and clear out Mary-Ann's bedroom, they discover a book of parenting advice on raising a transgender child, alongside a leaflet for a gay conversion camp. Both were given to Mary-Ann by her devout religious friend Tessa Vecchi, who runs a local caf\u00e9 and convenience store with her husband, Tom Vecchi. From Tessa, Tyler learns that Mary-Ann came to her for advice about Tyler, but reacted angrily when Tessa suggested a camp who runs a conversion therapy program. The twins eventually discover that Tessa attempted to report Mary-Ann to child services for allegedly endangering her children through poor parenting.\n\nTyler steps away from Alyson following an argument about the circumstances surrounding their mother's death, but regroups with his sister when she discovers a hidden loft area located above the family barn. The twins solve the puzzles using the Book of Goblins and realize the \"fairy-tales\" Mary-Ann told them were actually metaphors for her troubled past. Deducing that Tessa's husband Tom may be their biological father, the twins summon him to the house, where they threaten to publicly expose his secret affair with Mary-Ann, which could threaten his candidacy as mayor of Delos Crossing. Tom claims that Mary-Ann was actually attempting to calm a scared Tyler, when Alyson intervened and stabbed her to defend Tyler. Tyler rejects this as a lie to keep Alyson silent, but she suspects this to be the true sequence of events due to inconsistencies in the twins' own memories. Tyler admits they may never know the truth, but asks Alyson to decide whether she believe that Mary-Ann planned to commit a double-murder and suicide, or that she had planned to kill only herself when she was interrupted by Tyler.\n\nBy the story's end six months later, Tom loses the mayoral election. Depending on the player's choices, Tyler may move to Juneau and potentially started a relationship with Michael, or becomes a ranger on Kodiak Island otherwise. His bond with his sister is also strengthened or weakened over the course of the narrative.\n\nReception\nTodd Martens from Los Angeles Times noted that Dontnod Entertainment's decision to cast Tyler as the transgender lead of Tell Me Why is \"a rarity in all of mainstream entertainment but especially in video games\". Given the context of an expansive Q&A released by the developers explaining how they intended to portray Tyler, Stacey Henley noted that the idea of using gendered pronouns with consideration for transgender rights is controversy and risk provoking a backlash from some quarters. Calling Dontnod Entertainment's decision \"admirable\" and \"necessary\", Henley said it is clear the developers see Tyler for more than his gender identity, and Tell Me Why will inevitably be defined by its boldness in breaking new ground. Henley expressed an interest to see how it translates into the final product in an article published by VG247 in February 2020.\n\nThe character was very well received following the release of Tell Me Why. Devin Randall from Instinct reported that Tyler received an enthusiastic feedback from players on social media. Henley praised Tyler Ronan as the \"first truly well written transgender character\" in video game history, who \"comes with no strings attached\" and pushes \"queer representation in major video games into new territory\". Henley described Tyler as \"wonderful, so clearly shaped by his transness yet made of so much more than it\", and noted that while his sister Alyson played her part, \"Tyler steals the shows and gets all the best scenes\", highlighting two conversations in Chapters Two and Three in particular, as well as his depiction as a confident person. In a later article published by TheGamer, Henley rated Tyler more favorably compared to Claire from Cyberpunk 2077, \"both in terms of him as a person and the way his transness is explored\". Describing Tyler as \"complex, guarded and imaginative\", E.L. Meszaros from CBR argued that he was the most important video game protagonist of 2020. M. Deitz from The Michigan Daily praised the game's decision to not deadname Tyler as part of its storytelling, instead presenting him as \"all bearded out and confident in his masculinity\". \n \nThe character gained accolades for his depiction in Tell Me Why. Tyler was named Best LGBTQ Character at the inaugural Gayming Awards, which was presented by EA Games and broadcast worldwide through streaming platform Twitch on February 24, 2021. Tell Me Why was also awarded the Authentic Representation Award for its depiction of LGBT characters. Tyler also received a nomination for \"Best Character\" by the P\u00e9gases Awards. Alongside Erica Lindbeck as Alyson, Black earned a co-nomination for \"Outstanding Performance in a Drama, Lead\" by the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers' (NAVGTR) awards program honoring video game art, technology, and production in 2020.\n\nAnalysis\n\nAs part of their featured article about how Tell Me Why handles the issue of transgender representation through Tyler Ronan, GamesIndustry.biz interviewed a number of industry professionals who identify as transgender. Former games journalist Io Brindle said she was \"pleasantly surprised\" that Tyler experiences \"remotely corresponds to trans people's actual experience\". She appreciated how elements of his gender identity, life and history were presented simply as a story aspect which never dominates the wider plot or being designated as its \"ultimate truth\", and neither is it trivialized as \"incidental cosmetic detail\". She explained that similarly, gender transitioning is a vital experience for transgender individuals, but is never the only thing that matters in their lives.\n\nLeon Killin from consultancy firm Balance Patch concurred with Brindle's view that Tyler's gender identity is successfully portrayed in a nuanced or realistic manner, and noted that there is sufficient \"commonality\" between his daily life and that of Tyler's depiction, which enriches the representation and made it feel authentic. He believed it would be difficult to further improve trans representation in the game without effectively rewriting Tyler as character. Crucially, Killin drew attention to the fact that Tyler is identified as transgender through the character's own words: players may encounter his \"reminders to take testosterone shots and renew his prescription written on his wall calendar\", or hear about \"his self-directed discussions of binding and how he is considering chest surgery in the future\". Killin pointed out that not all transgender experiences are uniform however, and said Tyler's seemingly ample access to a means of transition would suggest that transgender representation in Tell Me Why is \"specifically for white, male-passing, trans men with a relatively smooth path by which to access their means of transition\".\n\nDeitz said the question of memory, a major theme in Tell Me Why, is \"doubly important\" for Tyler as a member of a sexual minority, because \"the issue becomes not only trusting but identifying with the past versions of himself\" and others in the LGBTQ+ community, exemplified by Tyler reliving moments in time prior to a self-awareness of his gender identity or sexual orientation, where he was once immersed in his \u201cnormal\u201d experiences. Within this context, Deitz said Tyler constantly faces this dilemma as he is no longer the same person as the one from ten years ago, but to move on with his life, he must unearth the causes of what happened in the past.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n\nAdventure game characters\nFictional American people in video games\nFictional characters from Alaska\nFictional prisoners and detainees in the United States\nFictional transgender men\nLGBT characters in video games\nMale characters in video games\nMicrosoft protagonists\nTelepath characters in video games\nTwin characters in video games\nVideo game characters introduced in 2020"}

Pockets of resistance however formed as German troops withdrew to the Atlantic coastal ports of Brest, Lorient, Saint-Nazaire, La Rochelle and Royan .\n\nThe Germans wanted to retain these strategic areas and declared them \"fortresses\" (). On 31 July 1944, Hitler ordered his Generals Jodl and Warlimont to \"defend them to the last man\". The hope was that these could once again become significant footholds on the Atlantic in the event that the secret weapons (Wunderwaffe) would be developed in time to turn the war back in the Reich's favour.\n\nAlso denying the Allies these deep-water ports would hamper operations following the Normandy campaign. The Allies also favoured a mainly eastward advance of the offensive towards Germany. They however left troops to protect the edges of these pockets, assisted by the French army and by battalions of the French Forces of the Interior (FFI) and Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP).\n\nThe Brest pocket fell on 18 September 1944 after hard fighting, the other four lasted until the surrender of the 8 May 1945, or shortly thereafter.\n\nGerman defences\nThis particular pocket centered on the town and fortified submarine base of Saint-Nazaire but spread out further. North of the Loire, the front line followed the left bank of the Vilaine river, then the Isac (the Nantes-Brest canal), as far as the part of Blain west of the canal; it then descended south-west to Cordemais, passing between Bouvron, Fay-de-Bretagne and Le Temple-de-Bretagne. South of the Loire, it included the municipalities of Frossay, Saint-Viaud, Paimb\u0153uf, Arthon-en-Retz (La Sicaudais), Saint-P\u00e8re-en-Retz, Saint-Brevin-les-Pins, Saint-Michel-Chef-Chef, La Plaine-sur-Mer, Pr\u00e9failles, Sainte-Marie-sur-Mer and Pornic. The coastal defensive sector of the pocket stretched over approximately  of coastline.\n\nThe Germans set up artillery batteries to defend the mouth of the Loire:\n A battery of two 240mm calibre guns of French origin was sited to the north at Batz-sur-Mer.\n A similar battery was located south of the Loire on the Pointe Saint-Gildas.\n Between these two batteries were other more modest calibre guns, in particular at the  with four 170mm guns and four 105mm guns, or, on the south shore, at Mindin and Pointeau in the commune of Saint-Brevin-les-Pins.\n There were also anti-aircraft defences comprising 80 large calibre pieces divided into about twenty batteries.\n\nIn total, the Germans had 700 guns of all kinds (fixed, mobile and anti-aircraft), with a higher density around the submarine base, the port facilities and the airfield.\n\nCloser to Saint-Nazaire, there was a belt of anti-tank ditches. The perimeter started from Fort de l'\u00c8ve, then north, crossing Maisac, Trignac, then along the Grande Bri\u00e8re marshes, Montoir-de-Bretagne until reaching the estuary coast at Donges. South of the Loire, the belt described a circle from Paimboeuf to the south of Saint-Brevin.\n\nAltogether it is estimated that this pocket fortress had 28,000 German soldiers commanded by Aviation General . The submarine base remained under the command of Admiral .\n\nAllied forces around the pocket\nThe isolation of the German forces was mainly entrusted to the units of the French Resistance:\n the  under (General Raymond Chomel),\n FFI and FTP battalions from Nantes, Vendee etc. French Resistance units were mainly armed with small arms and captured 75mm and 105mm guns.\n These were supported by units of the 94th US Infantry Division under Malony, divided between pockets in Lorient and Saint-Nazaire.\n At the end of December 1944 the 94th Division were relieved by the 66th US Infantry Division under Kramer.\n\nCivilians\nThe pocket also contained nearly 130,000 civilians. By October 1944, a large number of them (women and children) were allowed to leave the pocket, easing pressure on the Germans to feed them.\n\nOther convoys were subsequently organized by the Red Cross.\n\nTrains left the pocket near Cordemais. A temporary truce was observed between the belligerents during their journey. The refugees, once in Allied controlled Nantes, were subject to a questioning at the premises of the Lyc\u00e9e Georges Clemenceau, partly occupied by the American army.\n\nOther inhabitants left the pocket by their own means, in particular on its eastern and southern limits: for example, some of the inhabitants of Fession (Saint-Omer-de-Blain) left their farms, under constant American mortar fire at the end of November 1944, and went east through the mined lines.\n\nBetween November 1944 and February 1945, the Germans gradually evacuated the surroundings of the eastern front of (Fession and Saint-Gabriel in Saint-Omer, other localities in Bouvron and Fay-de-Bretagne); where inhabitants were invited to fall back inside the pocket or to leave on trains organised by the Red Cross.\n\nThe details of these evacuations are detailed by Father Fran\u00e7ois du Plessis de Gren\u00e9dan (1921-2013), Sulpician priest, son of the commander of the airship Dixmude, a chaplain of the FTP and FFI maquisards of the Saint-Nazaire Pocket (south, then north), worker-priest, in an interview book in 2007.\n\nMilitary operations\nFaced with fierce German resistance during the assault on Brest, the Allied High Command decided not to attempt a similar assault on Saint-Nazaire.\n\nAfter several raids launched in September and October against the FFI troops on the other side of the Vilaine river, the Germans carried out a new attack in the eastern sector at the beginning of November.\n\nApart from a small landing made in December at the  in Morbihan, the most important operations were carried out in the Pays de Retz in the South Loire, where stretches of fertile land were useful for supplies.\n\nThe Germans seized Frossay in October and at the end of December, following heavy fighting, the village of La Sicaudais. They were opposed by the 2nd Battalion FFI who ceded a stretch of nearly 100\u00a0km. The front stabilized thanks to the intervention of the \n\nThe Americans, for their part, dislodged the Germans from the , forcing them to return to the other side of the Nantes to Brest canal and seized the town of Blain.\n\nIn February 1945, thanks to secret agents inside the pocket fortress, the Resistance warned the Allies of an imminent German attack near the Nantes-Brest canal.\n\nDuring the month of March, American artillery managed to sink several cargo ships which had shuttled between the pocket fortresses of Lorient and Saint-Nazaire, thus increasing supply problems for the Germans.\n\nIn April, the Germans redoubled their aggression and constantly harassed the Allied positions with their artillery. On 19 April skirmishes occurred between three Franco-American patrols and the Germans causing three deaths and more than twenty wounded (and the loss of three tanks) on the Allied side and the loss of 33 men (dead or wounded) on the German side (by this time, on the Western front, Anglo-American troops had already largely invaded Germany and reached the Elbe).\n\nA prominent researcher, R\u00e9my Desquesnes estimates the overall losses on the Allied side at 500 killed, wounded or prisoners.\n\nSurrender\nAfter the signing of the overall German surrender in Reims on 7 May 1945, the German command in Saint-Nazaire began negotiations with the French about the surrender of the city, seeking guarantees about the treatment of prisoners and threatening to sabotage the port if a agreement could not be not reached. The signing of the pocket surrender agreement took place in the house of Francis Moisan, at a place called \"Les Sables\" in Cordemais on 8 May 1945 .\n\nThe fighting was supposed to end from 00:1 May 9, 1945. The German command however refused to surrender the city to French troops. In the southern sector of the \"pocket\", hostilities continued until the morning of 11 May 1945. The final surrender ceremony took place at noon that day at the Grand Clos racecourse in Bouvron. During this ceremony, General Hans Junck handed his weapon to the American General Herman Frederick Kramer in the presence of General Chomel, the prefect of Loire-Inf\u00e9rieure, Alexandre Vincent, and French and American detachments. The German command did not give the order for the destruction of port facilities and the sinking of ships remaining in the harbour of Saint-Nazaire.\n\nCommemoration\n\nA monument in the shape of a Lorraine cross was erected in 1949 in Bouvron to commemorate the signing of the surrender.\n\nThe Grand Blockhaus of Batz-sur-Mer has housed the museum of the Saint-Nazaire pocket since opening in 1997.\n\nSee also\n\n Liberation of France\n Battle for Brittany\n Battle of Brest\n Battle of Saint-Malo\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n \n \n \n Ganz, A.

{"eng_Latn":"Sietje Gravendeel-Tammens (29 July 1914 \u2013 27 September 2014) was a Dutch resistance leader and teacher. In 1944, she was sentenced to death, but survived because the sentence needed approval from Berlin.\n\nBiography\nSietje Tammens was born on a farm near Kloosterburen as the oldest of eight children. At first she wanted to become a Dutch Reformed pastor despite not being raised religiously. Ultimately she chose to study at a training college to become a teacher. In 1939, she left for Groningen as a private teacher for a mentally handicapped son of a professor. During this period, she specialized in speech-language pathology.\n\nWorld War II\nIn late 1941, Tammens became a teacher at a BLO school, special education for boys with learning difficulties. She found refuge for a Jewish boy from her school and his brother at a farm, which marked her first act of resistance. Her activities increased, and soon her house was used as a temporary shelter for refugees, and storage for stolen ration stamp and arms. In the summer of 1943, her house became the meeting place for the Groninger Top, the heads of the provincial resistance group. The Top consisted of five people of which Tammens was the sole female member, and had to vote on liquidations and armed actions. Her authority was never questioned, and she played a decisive role in determining reliability.\n\nOn 14 July 1943, Tammens organized the raid on a ration stamp distribution centre in Langweer. On 31 December 1943 the police chief Anne Elsinga was killed because he had discovered that Trouw was printed in Bedum. His successor Jannes Keijer was killed four months later by the group. The executions resulted in the Silbertanne Represailles. In the early morning of 25 April 1944 about 1,000 soldiers and SD surrounded the villages of Zuidwolde, Bedum, Stedum, Winsum, and Middelstum. Six men  were shot, and 148 were send to Nazi concentration camps, where 22 died.\n\nAn attempted execution of Klaas Prenger, a NSB (Dutch nazi party) colleague at her school, failed. He was shot, but survived. Tammens had to flee. She first found refuge in Harlingen, and later in Leeuwarden. Using the false name Martha Oosterveen, she nevertheless continued with her resistance work.\n\nArrest\nOn 13 June 1944, Tammens and others were caught in a trap at the Identity Cards Office in Amsterdam, and were arrested. She was sent to Herzogenbusch concentration camp in Vught, transferred to the Oranjehotel in Scheveningen and returned to Herzogenbusch.  The Sicherheitsdienst (SD) discovered her true identity, and she was transferred to the  in Groningen which was the local headquarters of the SD.\n\nUntersturmf\u00fchrer  sentenced her to death in August 1944, however in case of Germanic women a confirmation from Berlin was needed before the sentence could be carried out. Dolle Dinsdag (Mad Tuesday), a rumour that Breda had been liberated, caused a massive panic among the Germans, and resulted in a transfer to a work camp on the island of Borkum on 8 September 1944. In late March 1945, she bribed a soldier and managed to escape the camp and island. Later she was arrested in Emden, and taken to Camp Aurich, a subcamp of the Neuengamme concentration camp, where she was liberated by the Canadian Army.\n\nAfter the war\nTammens survived, but was unable to bear children after sexual abuse by a German guard in Borkum. In 1947, she left for Cura\u00e7ao as director of a school for special education. During her stay in Cura\u00e7ao, she met Cees Gravendaal. In 1964, Tammens retired to the Netherlands, and in 1979 married Cees Gravendaal. In 2000, the Resistance Museum in Groningen persuaded her to document her experiences. Sietje Tammens died on 27 September 2014 in Winsum aged 100. She donated her body to science.\n\nReferences\n\n1914 births\n2014 deaths\nDutch centenarians\nDutch resistance members\nDutch schoolteachers\nDutch school administrators\nNeuengamme concentration camp survivors\nPeople from De Marne\nWomen centenarians"}

{"eng_Latn":"Honor of the Samurai is a card game published by Gamewright in 1996 with a feudal Japanese setting that uses the themes of honor and family.\n\nDescription\nHonor of the Samurai is a card game for 3\u20136 players in which the players each take on the role of a Samurai who is working to accumulate personal Honor by helping their general (Daimyo) to become Shogun.\n\nComponents\nThe game comes with:\nrulebook \na deck of 110 cards that includes\nArmies (strength in battles)\nNinja (stealing and assassinations)\nDaimyo \nOkugata (honorable wives) \ncastles \nguards \n special objects (sword smiths, Noh theatre, black powder guns) \ntwo special actions: \"Dishonor\" and \"Save Face.\" \nsix six-sided dice with Japanese clan symbols in place of pips\ncardboard Honor chits (for tracking Honor)\n\nSetup\nEach player is given a Samurai card representing their character, and randomly picks a Daimyo to serve. These are placed face up in front of each player. The remaining Daimyos are shuffled into the general deck, and each player is then dealt seven cards. The deck, the Shogun card and the Honor chits are placed in the center of the table.\n\nGameplay\nEach player's turn has three phases:\n Collect Honor: The player adds up all the honor points on cards that are face up in front of the player, and takes that value in chits, leaving them beside the player's Daimyo. If the player has lost their Daimyo, the player cannot collect Honor.\n Calculating Ki and subsequent card actions: The player calculates how many card actions can be taken by adding up \"Ki\" displayed on all their face up cards and dividing by 3, to a maximum of five card actions. Card actions can include drawing a card, playing a card from their hand to their face-up collection, or discarding a card. Cards are played beside the Daimyo or the Samurai, each representing the two different houses.\n Making a declaration: The player may make one of four declarations: \n Declare their Daimyo to be Shogun (if the post is empty)\n Attack another Daimyo (if the attacking player's Daimyo is Shogun or if the attacking player has a face-up castle)\n If the player's Daimyo has been killed, the player is Ronin (lord-less) and can declare that they are allied to another Daimyo\n The player can also break an alliance.\n\nCombat\nIf a player attacks another player's Daimyo, then both players total up their strength total from face-up cards, divide by three and round down, resulting in the number of dice each player will throw. Each player rolls the number of dice indicated and totals the result; the higher value wins. The losing Daimyo is killed (unless the losing player plays the Save Face card. However, if the losing Daimyo was Shogun, this card cannot be used.) All of the losing Daimyo's cards are discarded, although the losing Samurai's house is unaffected. If the losing Daimyo was Shogun, the winning Daimyo becomes Shogun, even if the player does not want this.\n\nThe Samurai who has lost their Daimyo is Ronin and cannot accumulate any Honor unless they either play a new Daimyo card from their hand, or ally themselves to another player's Daimyo. In the latter case, both players allied to the same Daimyo can only score half of their Samurai's Honor and half of their shared Daimyo's Honor each turn. The Daimyo with two Samurai can use both of their Strengths in battle. A player wanting to get rid of a second Samurai allied to their Daimyo can give the second Samurai a new Daimyo card from their hand.\n\nOther cards\nNinja can be used to steal items from other players or kill Samurai or Daimyos.\nDishonor can be used to force another player to kill their Samurai or else face a hefty penalty in Honor.\n\nVictory conditions\nThe first player to attain 400 Honor points is the winner.\n\nPublication history\nHonor of the Samurai was designed by Scott Kimball, with artwork by Alexander Farquharson and Barbara Spelger. It was published in 1996 by Gamewright Games, with foreign language versions published by AMIGO and Corflx. Gamewright published a second edition in 2003.\n\nReception\nIn the August 1996 edition of Dragon (Issue #232), Rick Swan thought this game \"goes down as easily as a cup of hot chocolate.\" Although he found \"the rules are a little stiff, the cards a little bland, and I don't foresee see national Samurai tournaments any time soon,\" Swan concluded, \"That said, Honor of the Samurai remains a pleasant diversion and a great way to spend an afternoon on the patio with Dad.On the website Game Fanatics, Tomasz Z. Majkowski called this \"an excellent, dynamic social game, which is a lot of fun.\" He did note that \"It is difficult to call it a strategic game, because the combination of luck, the ability to quickly make the right decisions, diplomacy and tactics, and not a precisely balanced deck, determine the victory.\" He concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, \"The game can last from a quarter of an hour to several hours, depending on the involvement and cunning of the participants, but even long games are not boring, because the situation changes like a kaleidoscope and the most powerful men fall and then recover again. Let's add an attractive graphic design, faithfulness to historical realities and high flexibility - and we get a product, which is definitely worth your interest.\"\n\nOn the website Spielphase, Claudia Schlee and Andreas Keirat found the game relied too heavily on random chance, saying, \"The luck of the cards can be very decisive, because if a player does not have a second daimyo in their hand, the loss of this figure can cause the player to lose too much ground. In this case, allying yourself with a teammate will not win the game. Combats are easy to resolve, but a single throw at the end of the game decides who wins the game. This has always been unsatisfactory for everyone involved.\" They concluded, \"The game starts well, but somehow doesn't work properly and the outcome is almost entirely dependent on luck.\"\n\nReviewsPyramidBackstab'' (Issue 1 - Jan\/Feb 1997)\n\nReferences\n\nCard games introduced in 1996\nGamewright Games games"}

{"eng_Latn":"SDS BASIC, also known as CP-V BASIC, Batch BASIC or Sigma BASIC depending on the version, is a BASIC programming language compiler for  Scientific Data Systems's (SDS) Sigma series mainframe computers, originally released in 1967. Xerox purchased SDS in 1969 and began rebranding it as Xerox Data Systems, and finally just Xerox, at which time the language became known as Xerox BASIC.\n\nThe original versions did not include support for string variables, although this was added for the version running under the CP-V operating system when it was released in 1971. The string library allowed manipulation of strings using array slicing syntax, similar to the system found in HP Time-Shared BASIC and a number of microcomputer BASICs like Integer BASIC and Atari BASIC.\n\nThis style of string manipulation differs from the model introduced in DEC's BASIC-PLUS, which used string functions. Altair BASIC was patterned on BASIC-PLUS, and this style became the de facto standard after the cross-platform version, Microsoft BASIC, became almost universal during the home computer era. This makes conversion from SDS to modern dialects somewhat difficult.\n\nSDS BASIC is historically notable as the platform on which the original Star Trek computer game was written in the summer of 1971.\n\nSyntax \nIn keeping with the original Dartmouth BASIC model, and in common with most mainframe-based BASICs, SDS BASIC was a compiler, not an interpreter, and used separate but tightly integrated tools for editing and running. The editor was dedicated to BASIC; as lines are entered they are analyzed for correct syntax and then stored in tokenized form. If a line is entered with a number at the start, it is placed into the appropriate location in the program based on the number, lines without numbers were immediately processed and then forgotten. SDS allowed line numbers in the range 1 to 99999. A simple example is:\n\n10 PRINT \"HELLO WORLD\"\n\nLike many versions of BASIC, SDS allowed a single line of code to contain multiple statements. In most dialects this is indicated using the colon, but SDS used either the backslash,  or ampersand, . An equivalent line in SDS would be:\n\n10 PRINT \"HELLO\" \\ PRINT \"WORLD\"\n\nBecause SDS was a compiler, and the user's source code was stored separately, it preserved leading spaces in the code. They suggested using this to more clearly indicate the structure of loops:\n\n10 LET J=0, K=1\n20 FOR I=K TO 8\n30    PRINT J\n40    M=J, J=K, K=K+1\n50 NEXT I\n\nThis example also includes the ability to set multiple values in a single LET statement, as seen in lines 10 and 40. This feature was also found in HP BASIC. As in most versions of BASIC, the keyword  is optional, and is left out of line 40. Line 40 also illustrates the alternate form of assignment seen in a number of early BASICs, where multiple assignments can be separated with commas.\n\nCommon mathematical operations included , ,  and , using  or  for exponents. Logical comparisons, like HP, could be written in any order, so  was equivalent to , and  was the same as . Most dialects only allow the later syntax in both cases. Unlike HP BASIC, SDS did not include the ability to use the hash, , as an alternate form of .\n\nSDS supported computed GOTO using ON, but also allowed the alternate syntax with the ON at the end of the line instead of the front:\n\nGOTO 140,160,180 ON Y\n\nAn alternate form of REM was a leading star, , similar in purpose to the short-form found in MS-derived BASICs, the single quote, .\n\nString handling\nThe early versions of SDS BASIC, sometimes known as Batch BASIC or BTM BASIC, did not support string variables. However, string values could be assigned to numeric variables which could store six characters as their EBCDIC numeric values. The later CP-V BASIC added true string variables containing up to 132 characters that could be indicated with a trailing dollar sign, , or uncommonly, a leading $ \u2014  and  are equivalent. The manual notes that the latter format was added for compatibility with A00 BASIC.\n\nInternally, CP-V used a fixed-length string layout consisting of an array of bytes that could not be changed in size at runtime. This was similar to the other BASICs that used slicing notation, like HP and Atari. It contrasts with the DEC\/Microsoft style, where strings were dynamically allocated on a heap. Unlike the other fixed-length BASIC dialects, string variables did not have to be DIMmed prior to use, instead, all strings defaulted to a maximum length of 72 characters. This was a global setting that could be changed to better manage memory by setting it to a smaller value, or allow longer strings up to a maximum of 132 characters. This was accomplished using . Confusingly, SET was also used for the entirely unrelated task of allowing variables to be used in DIM statements.\n\nBecause strings in CP-V did not present themselves publicly as arrays of characters, the slicing syntax was not based on array syntax. This meant CP-V also allowed the construction of arrays of strings, something dialects like HP and Atari lacked because they used array notation for slicing. One could thus make a matrix of strings using DIM:\n\n10 DIM A$(5,10)\n\nwould define a matrix containing a total of 50 72-character strings in a 5 by 10 matrix. Because the system supported arrays, slicing syntax was somewhat more complex than the system found in other versions. Examples include:\n\nA$(1)\n\nselects the first string in an array of strings, while:\n\nA$(1,5)\n\nselects a string from location 1,5 in a 2D array (matrix). Slicing was handled by adding a colon within the parens:\n\nA$(:4)\n\nreturned everything from the 4th character on:\n\nA$(:4,5)\n\nselects five characters starting with the 4th character, while:\n\nA$(1,5:4,5)\n\nselects five characters starting with the 4th character of the string in locations 1,5 in a 2D array.\n\nString constants could be delimited with either single or double quotes, making it easier to enclose quotes within lines. Valid examples include:\n\nPRINT 'THIS IS A STRING LITERAL'\nPRINT \"THIS IS ANOTHER ONE\"\nPRINT 'AND THIS IS \"A THIRD\"'\nPRINT \"AND 'A FOURTH'\"\nCP-V also includes the CHANGE command from Dartmouth BASIC, which converts a string into a series of EBCDIC numeric values and places them into a numeric array:\n\n10 DIM B(6)\n20 CHANGE \"ABCDEF\" TO B\n\nB will now contain a series of numbers corresponding to the EBCDIC values for each character.\n\nInput\/output\nSDS included a robust system for input\/output based on \"stream\" numbers that could be specified in PRINT and INPUT statements. For instance, data could be read from a file using:\n\n10 OPEN 'FILE1' TO :1,INPUT\n20 INPUT :1,A\n\nThe first line opens a disk file with the name \"FILE1\", assigns it to stream 1, and indicates it will be used for input. The second line reads the next data from stream 1, in this case the first value, and assigns the resulting data to variable A. The system also included a unique \"key\" system that allowed data to be numbered and then accessed randomly. This was accomplished by adding the key number after a semicolon:\n\nINPUT :1;9999,A\n\nwill attempt to read record 9999. Valid keys were in the range .001 to 9999.999, and if no keys were assigned in the files, lines were assigned numbers 1.000, 2.000, etc. The highest-valued key in a file could read using:\n\nKEY(1)\n\nwhere the 1 is the stream number. Unstructured binary data could be read and written byte-at-a-time using GET and PUT.\n\nMAT commands \nLater versions of Dartmouth BASIC included a suite of MAT commands that allowed operations on entire arrays (matrices) with a single statement. These were also available in SDS BASIC. In their simplest form, the MAT is used like an alternate form of LET, applying an expression to all the elements in an array. For instance:\n100 DIM A(20),B(20)\n...\n200 MAT A=A+B\nWill add the value of every value in B to every entry in A, in the same fashion as:\n100 DIM A(20),B(20)\n...\n200 FOR I=1 TO 20\n210 A(I)=A(I)+B(I)\n220 NEXT I\nAs well as making the code shorter and more obvious, these commands also have the advantage of being highly optimized, easily outperforming the use of FOR\/NEXT. Additional functions and statements modify PRINT and INPUT, invert arrays, and build identity matrixes and such in a single statement.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n \n\nBASIC compilers\nBASIC programming language\nBASIC programming language family"}
{"eng_Latn":"Nathan Wiens is a Canadian naturalistic designer and woodworker. Wiens founded Chapel Arts in the Railtown district of Vancouver in 2006.\n\nChildhood and youth\nNathan Wiens is the son of architect Clifford Wiens and artist (pottery) and educator Patricia Wiens. The family visited art galleries, attended powwows, and played music at home. As a child, the young Wiens was also a potter. He says his father had \"immeasurable influence\" on him: \"He and my mother created a rich creative environment for my five sisters and myself... He has been a tough act to follow, but he's left me room to rise as my own man.\"\n\nIn high school, Wiens played in a band called \"Nick Danger\" with Colin James.\n\nCareer\nIn the early to mid 1980s Wiens worked in the music industry \"as a builder, roadie and performer\" in the \"underground\" punk music scene. Wiens travelled to Vancouver, British Columbia for the first time during Expo 86 to work on installations with Edward Poitras and over time established himself there working as an artist and producer.\n\nWoodworker\nWiens is known as a craftsman of naturalistic custom wood furniture pieces, but he is sometimes willing to reproduce some pieces, such as dining room table with a curved indent which proved popular. In Vancouver, his work may be found in stores such as ALife and John Fluevog (the biggest client), as well as the Shine nightclub and the Edgewater Casino.\n\nProcess\nWiens describes his woodworking process as \"tunnelling\", something influenced by his experience with pottery as a child:We shuffle a deck of all these parts that create shapes, out of flat panels, kind of like a topographical map, using the CNC machine.  Like architectural models do the landscape \u2013 in  layers.  We do this with wood, on budgets sometimes modest, sometimes grand.\nLarge scale pieces have come out of the process in the manner of matrioschka, one piece fitting inside the other.\n\nStudio\n\nIn about 2004, Wiens was looking for a place to relocate his Yaletown furniture business. He found a garage at Dunlevy and Cordova in Downtown Eastside, but had to buy the Armstrong Funeral Chapel as part of the deal. The studio has 22-foot ceilings topped by strips of Douglas fir, and \"piles\" of reclaimed fir beams which he acquired from torn down warehouses, as well as local walnut, maple, butternut and oak. In a 2009 interview, he remarked: \"Most people aren't using the vast variety of local exotics, especially on a commercial level\".\n\nChapel Arts venue and gallery\n\nThe funeral home Wiens bought was originally known as the Chapel of Flowers. The building is thought to date back to 1892 or 1893, a house at first, with additions to the building in 1911 or 1912 when it became Armstrong and Hotson Undertakers, and then in 1936 an art deco fa\u00e7ade was added giving the appearance of a single structure. It was renamed Armstrong & Co. Funeral Directors. Like the studio, the interior has high ceilings.\n\nSeeing that the building he was purchasing came with a hall, Wiens saw its potential as a centre for the arts and other purposes: \"Once I owned the chapel, I envisioned it as a family, community arts and multi-use facility.\u202fThe community is always screaming for such facilities, which remain scarce in the area, so it served a need.\" He spent several months renovating and refurbishing it until it officially opened as a 126-seat venue in December 2006 with a live concert. Wiens christened the new venue Chapel Arts. It has since evolved into a group of \"creators, fabricators, and artists\" led by Wiens.\n\nThe performance space is located on the lower level in the 1936 addition, formerly the funeral chapel itself, next to which is a hidden driveway, originally for the hearse, while at the other side of the performance space is the 1911\/2 addition, the original chapel. The upper level, once the coffin display room, now serves as a community art gallery.\n\nSince the Spring of 2008, Chapel Arts has hosted various acts and community events, concerts, parties, meetings, and grad shows for, among others, Kwantlen Polytechnic University's visual arts program and the Emily Carr University of Art and Design.\n\nRelated pursuits\nWiens has collaborated with MascallDance on more than one occasion, notably Caribou (1991) for Ron Stewart and Outliner (2016), a solo performance by his sister Robin Poitras, for whom he created dresses made out of wood.\n\nPersonal life\nWhen asked about the significance of naming his workshop The chapel, Wiens said he is not religious: \"I was raised in a family filled with artists and stuff, so I guess that's what I believe in. I believe in makers instead of The Maker.\"\n\nNote\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nNathan Wiens on Aha Media\nChapel Arts on Aha Media\nChapel Arts on YouTube\n\n1960s births\nLiving people\nArtists from Regina, Saskatchewan\nCanadian male artists\nCanadian woodworkers\n21st-century Canadian artists\n21st-century Canadian male artists"}
{"eng_Latn":"William Edgar Easton (March 19, 1861January 10, 1936) was an American playwright, journalist, and political activist. He wrote two plays about the Haitian Revolution and its aftermath: Dessalines (1893), a historical drama about Jean-Jacques Dessalines; and Christophe (1911), a drama about Henri Christophe, King of Haiti following the Revolution.\n\nLife\n\nEarly years (1861\u20131883)\nEaston was born on March 19, 1861, in New York City, to Marie Antoinette Leggett-Easton and Charles F. Easton. His mother was a native French speaker whose family had immigrated to New Orleans from France; the Eastons spoke both English and French at home. Marie Antoinette Leggett-Easton was descended from a participant in the Haitian Revolution.\n\nOn his father's side, he was a descendant of Moses Easton, the brother of James Easton. James was a veteran of the Revolutionary War\u2014he planned the fortification of Dorchester Heights\u2014and a prominent figure in the Black community of Massachusetts in the early Republic.\n\nAlthough born in New York, Easton grew up mainly in New Bedford, Massachusetts. His mother died when he was 13 years old. Following her death, he came under the care of his godmother, whom Beasley calls the \"Baroness de Hoffman\". The Baroness, in turn, put Easton under the care of an unnamed Catholic priest.\n\nThereafter, Easton attended school at a number of Catholic institutions: a seminary in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec, likely the S\u00e9minaire Saint-Joseph de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res; La Salle Academy in Providence, Rhode Island; and in a \"college of the Congregation of St Croix\". Beasley does not record which college this was, but the use of the French term Sainte Croix for \"Holy Cross\" suggests that Easton attended one of the several schools in Quebec organized by the Congregation. Another source claims he attended \"St. Caesar's College, Canada\". This appears to be a reference to Coll\u00e8ge Saint-C\u00e9saire, in Saint-C\u00e9saire, Quebec, which founded in 1869 by a member of the Congregation of Holy Cross.\n\nTexas (1883\u20131901)\nEaston moved to Texas at age 22. Price notes that was a momentous and somewhat unusual decision for Easton to have made, given that he was \"a young man just out of a Canadian Catholic seminary\".\n\nHe married Mary Elizabeth Easton in 1888 in Austin. He worked as a teacher from roughly 1882 to 1885.\n\nWhile in Texas, Easton edited at least three newspapers: the Citizen, the Blade, and the Globe. He later served as the inaugural president of the Colored State Press Association.\n\nHe also held a number of positions with the state Republican Party, beginning an activist career that would last long after he departed Texas.\n\nCalifornia (1901\u20131936)\nEaston appears to have moved to California sometime in 1901: in July 1924, he recorded in a biographical sketch he completed for the California State Library that he been in California for 23 years. At the time he completed that profile, he lived at 1764 West 35th Street, Los Angeles and had three daughters and one son.\n\nWhile in California, he held various positions in journalism and politics. Among many other jobs, he worked for a time as a speechwriter for the Republican and Progressive parties.\n\nIn 1911, he published an editorial in the Los Angeles Herald, denouncing the assault of Booker T. Washington that year in New York City. He wrote: \"[t]he ruthless murder of Dr. Washington (call it by its proper name, for that was what was intended) would not only have been the crowning misfortune of the colored race, but a dreadful menace to the state\u2014to the whole nation, the nation that is at this time so seriously endeavoring to solve a most  problem\".\n\nDuring World War I, he was picked by Emmett Jay Scott to serve as a member of the Speakers Bureau of the Department of War. After the war ended, he was \"designated by the California Historical Survey Commission as chairman of a sub-committee of the California War History Committee to gather and preserve material and information regarding the activities of the colored race in California in connection with their part in helping to win the war\".\n\nEaston died on January 10, 1936, at his home in Los Angeles. He was buried at Calvary Cemetery.\n\nReligious views\nEaston was Catholic until \"sometime after \u2026 1893\", when he joined the African Methodist Episcopal Church. He had previously been active in the Colored Catholic Congress, founded in the late 1880s by Daniel Rudd.\n\nIn 1893, he delivered a lecture on \"The Catholic Church and the Negro Race\" at St. Joseph's Hall in New Orleans.\n\nWorks\n\nEaston wrote two plays that received wide notice at the time, both about prominent figures in the Haitian Revolution: Dessalines (1893) and Christophe (1911). Henrietta Vinton Davis produced and starred in both. He also wrote two other short plays, Is She a Lady in the Underworld? and Misery in Bohemia, which do not seem to have been staged.\n\nDessalines\nHill and Hatch describe Dessalines as a \"romantic melodrama written in blank verse\". The titular character and male lead of Dessalines is Jean-Jacques Dessalines, a key figure in Haiti's early military and political history. The plot concerns Dessalines's exploits and his relationship with Clarisse, a (probably) mythical figure who converts him to Christianity. Byrd and Twa note that the play glosses over Dessalines's \"massacres\" and \"despotism\" in favor of a focus on religious and romantic themes.\n\nByrd argues that Dessalines should be interpreted in light of late 19th-century views of Black masculinity in America. The ideology of white supremacy painted Black people\u2014and in, particular, Black men\u2014as weak, uncivilized, and incapable of running their own affairs. In the view of a number of contemporary Black intellectuals, the example of Haiti and its revolution provided a counterpoint to this ideological fiction: Haiti was an independent republic, like the United States, which had expelled its colonial governors and created a new nation.\n\nIn his preface to Dessalines, Easton lamented what he saw as a failure to properly memorialize the heroic deeds of Black people:The Negro alone fails to immortalize his distinguished dead, and leaves to the prejudiced pen of other races, the office, which, by a proper conception of duty to posterity, very properly becomes his duty. \u2026\n\u2026 the author of this work hopes to see a happier era inaugurated by the constant production of legitimate drama, written exclusively for Negro players and meeting, he hopes, with the full endorsement of the brother in white.\nFor the reasons, as above enumerated, has the author presumed to lay on the altar of race pride the dramatic tale of the heroic Dessalines.The Chicago premiere of Dessalines was at Freiburg's Opera House, on 22nd Street, in September 1893. It featured \"a complete cast of colored characters\". Henrietta Vinton Davis played Clarisse.\n\nThe premiere was scheduled to coincide with the 1893 World's Columbian Exhibition, but was not billed officially as part of the Exhibition program. Rather, Twa observes that it was staged in \"protest against the Exposition's exclusion of African Americans in its planning and the rejection of many proposals for exhibits to display the accomplishments of African Americans\". Hill and Hatch count two other runs of Dessalines: one in Pittsburgh in 1909, which Davis directed and starred in; and one in Boston in 1930, in a company led by Maud Cuney Hare.\n\nThe play was reviewed in the Indianapolis Freeman in April 1893. The reviewer expressed some displeasure that Easton had not chosen a subject from American history, writing:\u2026 we sincerely hope \u2026 the splendid inspiring example set by Mr. Easton being emulated, will yet give us from the pen of some one of our many brilliant and growing crop of race writers, a drama purely American \u2026The Freeman later offered its readers a copy of Dessalines as part of a holiday promotion.\n\nAlbion W. Tourg\u00e9e reportedly stated at the time that Dessalines was \"the highest evidence of literary culture thus far produced by an American negro\".\n\nChristophe\nChristophe, reportedly written for Davis, was staged in New York and Los Angeles in spring 1912. In New York, it opened at the Lenox Casino in Harlem, at 102 West 116th Street and Lenox Avenue (now known as Malcolm X Boulevard).\n\nBesides Davis, cast members included R. Henri Strange, Lawrence Chenault, Frederick Douglass Hogan, Otis Sherman, and Blanche DeForrest.\n\nProceeds from the New York staging went to a provisional Black regiment of the New York National Guard commanded by Charles W. Fillmore.\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n1861 births\n1936 deaths\n20th-century African-American writers\n20th-century American dramatists and playwrights\nAfrican-American Catholics\nAfrican-American dramatists and playwrights\nWriters from Los Angeles\nWriters from New Bedford, Massachusetts"}

{"eng_Latn":"Virginia Tacci (1566 or 1567 \u2013 d. after 1581), was an Italian equestrian who was the first woman to ride in a famous horse race in Siena.\n\nTacci rode on 15 August 1581 in the challenging race that was the predecessor of today's Palio di Siena. As a 15-year-old girl, she came to be regarded as a role model for women in Siena and has been remembered as a pioneer female jockey.\n\nThe race \n\nThe historic race is part of the city's celebration of the Feast of the Assumption on August 15.\n\nThe race, which is still run today, takes place in the center plaza of Siena with ten horses competing, representing only 10 of the 17 city districts (the lucky ten are chosen in part by lottery). Each jockey is chosen by leaders of each contrade, or city ward. The racecourse is held inside the city's main plaza, the Piazza del Campo, which is paved with a hard surface, but covered with layers of earth for this occasion.\n\nIn 1581, the jockeys were small and light (usually boys) and rode bareback around the track lined with spectators and buildings. Races were known to be dangerous to both horses and riders and took less than 90 seconds from start to finish.\n\nTacci's ride \nTacci was selected by Sienna's Drago ward\/neighborhood.It was therefore the Contrada dell'Aquila that organized the festival [in 1581], which also presented those of the Liofante (the current Tower), the Wave, the Montone, the Giraffa, the Goose, the Lupa and the Drago. They all brought their horse with a little boy as a rider. But the Dragon, instead of a young man, placed a peasant girl on his steed.The Count of Montauto wrote about the race at the time:Among the most ridiculous and marvelous things one sees, is that a villanella of about 14 has a barbarian to run: and she is on it with such confidence and gracefulness that it is something not to be believed. With her an infinite number of people, she is so well suited to that act of riding; so much so that it seems that other women envy her and that some plan to learn that art, seeing that riding well is a good way to acquire the grace of the men. This young girl began to practice in the course: and the other day, because the foul-mouthed horse jumped across certain beams, not without manifest danger of breaking her neck, she did not get lost, nor did she sign to fall, but with much art and dexterity she corrected and retained it.On the day of the race, Tucci fell from her steed before finishing. Still, it was noted, \"It is known that the Governor of the Contrada gave Virginia a beautiful horse.\"\n\nLegacy \nThe next woman to ride in the Palio did so almost four hundred years later, in 1957, when Rosanna Bonelli rode using the nickname Diavola in the Contrada dell'Aquila.

Prior to the season, Teresa Huang was hired as the story editor for the series. On June 12, 2020, the series' writers announced that they had started working on writing for the season.\n\nThis was also the first and only season without Peter M. Lenkov as showrunner, after he was fired from both MacGyver and Magnum P.I. on July 7, 2020 by CBS, following allegations that he created a toxic work environment. Lenkov had also been the showrunner for Hawaii Five-0, which had already concluded its ten season run prior to his firing. Also, as a result of his firing, he also lost the final year on his overall deal with CBS Television Studios. In response to his firing, Lenkov said, \"I accept responsibility for what I am hearing, and am committed to doing the work that is required to do better and be better.\" Monica Macer, who was hired as an executive producer on the series in June 2020, replaced Lenkov as the showrunner. Series star Lucas Till said that Lenkov's actions, particularly during the first season, caused him to feel suicidal, and drove him to his breaking point. Till also said that Lenkov bullied, verbally abused, and body-shamed him. A spokesperson for Lenkov stated that Till's accusations were not true, and that Lenkov had always supported Till.\n\nOn August 12, 2020, it was announced that CBS Television Studios had signed a deal with the law enforcement advisory group 21CP Solutions, to consult on its crime and legal dramas, which includes MacGyver. 21CP Solutions will help the series' to more accurately portray law enforcement. This comes after the George Floyd protests, which caused the television industry to rethink their portrayal of law enforcement.\n\nFilming\nOn November 11, 2020, Justin Hires announced that filming had started on the season. There were nine remaining episodes written for the fourth season that were then completed and aired as part of the fifth season. Filming on the season had been completed prior to the series' cancellation.\n\nCasting\nOne of the remaining episodes from the fourth season included a crossover appearance from Jorge Garcia as Jerry Ortega, his character from Hawaii Five-0.\n\nOn February 18, 2021, it was announced that Alexandra Grey had been cast in a recurring role as Parker, a transgender female Phoenix engineer who assists the team. The following day, Ernie Hudson and Wendy Raquel Robinson were revealed to have been cast as Milton and Lauretta Bozer, the parents of Hires' character, Wilt. Multiple actors reprised their roles from previous seasons, including Aly Michalka and David Dastmalchian.\n\nCancellation and future\n\nOn April 7, 2021, it was announced that MacGyver would end after five seasons with the series finale being set for April 30, 2021. The series was averaging 5.85 million viewers an episode when the decision was made. Kelly Kahl, CBS' Entertainment President, stated about the decision \"All of us at CBS are extremely grateful for the incredible work and dedication from Lucas and the rest of the cast, as well as Monica, the writers and the entire crew, the MacGyver team traveled far and wide to repeatedly save the world with little more than bubble gum and a paper clip and made this show distinctly their own. We're gratified we get to give this dedicated and loyal fan base the opportunity to say goodbye to their favorite characters in the thoughtful manner this series deserves.\" Macer said the news came as a shock to her and that the network informed her of the cancellation first and allowed her time to tell the cast and crew prior to making the news public. Because filming on the season was finished, Macer also had to turn what she planned on being a season finale, into a series finale using the already completed footage. Once the news became public, fans of the series organized a loose campaign titled \"#SaveMacGyver.\" Within 48 hours a hashtag calling for the renewal of the series trended on Twitter in multiple countries, gaining over 116,000 tweets in support. A Change.org petition with the same goal raised over 29,000 signatures. 1.35 million paperclips, a signature tool of Angus MacGyver's were sent to CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles, California, with several thousand more sent directly to Kahl's office in New York City. Numerous billboards were also purchased in effort of the campaign.\n\nFollowing the series finale, Macer shared her plans for a sixth season in an interview. The planned sixth season would have included a Black Hawk Down-style episode centered around Tran's character, Desi, and her presumed dead ex-fianc\u00e9, Evan. This storyline would have allowed a romance between MacGyver and Riley, the characters of Till and Mays, respectively; who would have gotten together early in the sixth season. In 2022 Lenkov also shared his original plans for a fifth season finale that also would have set up a sixth season. In a rough scriptment for the fifth season finale, titled \"Biometric + Compass + Paperclip + Family + Goodbye\", the episode would have featured a time jump to the year 2035 that introduced the future son of MacGyver and Riley. The time jump would have also led to a relationship between MacGyver and Riley early in the sixth season. In Macer's version of the sixth season Desi and Evan would have began a relationship; Riley then would have attempted to resign from the Phoenix Foundation, causing a fight between MacGyver and Riley that led to their first kiss. Other storylines for Macer's sixth season would have included Cusick's and Arfwedson's characters having a child; further exploration of the parents of Hires' character; and Eaton's character assigning Riley to an undercover project.\n\nRelease\nThe season premiered during the 2020\u201321 television season as part of CBS's Friday lineup with Magnum P.I. and Blue Bloods. On August 26, 2020, it was announced that CBS hoped to begin airing the season in November 2020. On November 9, 2020, it was announced that the season would premiere on December 4, 2020.\n\nViewing figures\n\nReferences\n\nMacGyver (2016 TV series)\n2020 American television seasons\n2021 American television seasons"}
{"eng_Latn":"The 1951 Boston University Terriers football team was an American football team that represented Boston University as an independent during the 1951 college football season. In its fifth season under head coach Aldo Donelli, the team compiled a 6\u20134 record and outscored their opponents by a total of 299 to 157. Although they finished with four losses (including their final game of the season against an average 5\u20134 Syracuse team), defeated only one  opponent that was ranked at the time of the game (No. 16 Pacific (CA), which finished 6\u20135 and unranked), and defeated no opponents that finished with a winning percentage above .600 other than 7\u20133 William & Mary, the Terriers still managed to secure a spot on the final AP Poll, just shy of the top 15. This was largely due to two first place votes that were granted to the team, becoming only the second team to receive first place votes in the final poll with a winning percentage of .600 or worse, the first being 5\u20134\u20131 Holy Cross in 1942. The 1951 Boston team is considered by James Vautravers, a college football historian who analyzes past AP polls, to be the worst AP rated team of all time.

{"eng_Latn":"The Andover Public Schools district is the public school district for the town of Andover, Massachusetts. Overseeing 10 educational facilities, ranging from pre-kindergarten to the 12th grade, the district is administrated by superintendent Magda Parvey, who reports directly to an elected school committee, consisting of five residents of the town elected for three-year terms.\n\nHistory\n\nDistricts schools system\nIn the mid and late 18th century, Andover was divided into two parishes, north and south respectively, and centered in each were grammar schools to serve the children of those regions. In 1753, Andover housed five \"reading and writing schools\" and by March 1795, each parish would contain six district schools. The twelve schools would continue to operate until the District School system was abolished in 1866 when the Andover Public Schools district would assume the responsibilities for all schools in the town, rather than have each school operate independently by members of their district.\n\nThe Punchard Free School\nAlthough Andover had been home to an early secondary education 'industry', with such private institutions as Phillips Academy in 1778 and Andover Theological Seminary in 1807, the town would not have their first public high school until 1854 with the foundation of the Punchard Free School. After his death, Benjamin Hanover Punchard, an Andover resident, left $50,000 for the purpose of building a high school which any qualified resident of the town could attend without charge. The first graduating class in 1857 consisted of seven students. Although the original school was destroyed in a fire in 1869, the school would continue to operate out of Town Hall until facilities were rebuilt in 1871. The Trustees of Punchard's estate and the Town of Andover would evenly split the staffing expenses for the school, until 1904 when the Punchard Trust no longer could contribute funds. The Andover Public Schools District would assume all expenses, and the school was renamed to Punchard High School.\n\nRenovations and additions to Punchard\nThe property on Bartlet street would grow through the late 19th and 20th centuries into a sizable academic campus. As early as 1888, a grammar school (serving grades 5\u20138) was erected on an abutting property to 36 Bartlet St. The school was originally named the Center Grammar School, but was renamed less than a decade later in 1894 to the Stowe School in honor of Harriet Beecher Stowe, who resided in the town. In 1916, a new wing was added to Punchard and held additional educational space as well as offices for the Superintendent of schools. By 1934, renovations became necessary, so the 1871 Punchard building was demolished, making room for an auditorium, gymnasium, and Junior High School. Punchard school and the new Andover Junior High would function as separate schools, although at the same facility.\n\nMove of Andover High School to Shawsheen Road\nAfter almost a decade of service, Punchard High School was retired in 1958 upon the opening of a new Andover High School on Shawsheen Road, the property which is today West Middle School. Andover Junior High School continued to operate out of the building at 36 Bartlet Street. A decade later in 1968, Andover High School would move to a neighboring building which is where it remains to this day; the former building was repurposed for an additional junior high school in the town and was named West Junior High School. As a result, the junior high school on Bartlet street (Andover Junior High) was renamed to East Junior High School, in contrast.\n\n1982 renovations to Bartlet Street \nAmong the many schools that had been erected on the Bartlet Street campus, the Central elementary school \u2013 which would later be renamed to the Doherty school in 1972 to commemorate long serving school committee member Bill Doherty \u2013 was one of several town buildings that had shown significant age by the 1980s. By 1982, plans to renovate the educational campus were underway; the Stowe school, the Jackson school and a heating plant were razed. East Junior High School was repurposed for town and school administrative offices, and subsequently was closed. The old Doherty School was renovated and served as a replacement Junior High school, but kept the namesake and operated as Doherty Junior High School.\n\nChange from junior high school to middle school\nThe junior high schools in Andover served grades 7-9 and the Senior High School facilitated grades 10-12 until 1988 when the town restructured their educational stage structure from a junior high system to a Middle school system. Andover students would attend elementary school until 5th grade, and would then attend middle school for grades 6 through 8. The senior high school facilitated pupils for the remaining four years of their study until graduation from the public school system after grade 12. As a result, the two junior high schools in the district (Doherty and West) were renamed respectively to Doherty Middle School and West Middle School, as they have remained to this day.\n\n21st-century additions \nAt the 1999 town meeting, Andover allocated $31.9\u00a0million to construct a new elementary and middle school. High Plain Elementary School and Wood Hill Middle school were built as a single building, but designed to operate as two separate educational institutions. By 2002, the schools opened with construction being 97% complete by September 5 of that year. This brought the total number of elementary schools to six and total middle schools to three. By 2014, the structural integrity of Bancroft elementary school had become a burden to the Town of Andover, costing more than $1\u00a0million per year to maintain. As a result, the old school was demolished and a new one was built in its place. Bancroft Elementary remains the most recently constructed school in the town, despite controversy to renovate and rebuild other plants and facilities.\n\nSchools\n\nOverview\n\nShawsheen Preschool \n\nThe Shawsheen School is the only school under the jurisdiction of Andover Public Schools that facilitates a Pre-kindergarten program. Although the school is considered public, tuition is subsidized by families, with rates ranging from $2,350 to $5,265 per year (for 2019\u20132020).\n\nElementary schools\n\nBancroft Elementary School\n\nHenry C.

Formerly the Punchard Free School, the school produces approximately 450 graduates each year, which is 96% of the total enrolled senior class. Most notably, alumni of Andover High School include actor Michael Chiklis, comedian Jay Leno and professional Golfer Rob Oppenheim.\n\nDistrict Demographics \nPer Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education annual statistics for the 2022\u20132023 academic year, the Andover Public Schools district accommodates 5,487 pupils from grades PK-12, with an additional 39 Special education students beyond the 12th grade, totaling 5,526 overall.\n\nSee also\nAndover High School (Massachusetts)\nAndover, Massachusetts\nGreater Lawrence Technical School\nPhillips Academy\n\nReferences\n\nAndover, Massachusetts\nSchool districts established in 1866\nSchool districts in Essex County, Massachusetts"}
{"eng_Latn":"Metehan Kocaba\u015fo\u011flu (born 4 March 1993) is a German professional wrestler of Turkish descent. He was signed to WWE, where he performed on the NXT UK brand under the ring name Teoman.\n\nHe is best known for his work with Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw), where under the ring name Lucky Kid and under his birth name Metehan, his accomplishments include being a one-time wXw Shotgun Champion, a one-time wXw World Tag Team Champion and the winner of 16 Carat Gold.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\n\nEarly career (2008\u20132015) \nKocaba\u015fo\u011flu initially aspired to be a professional footballer, but after sustaining a knee injury, he was forced to give it up. A friend of his, Cem Kaplan, told him about the professional wrestling school at the German Wrestling Federation (GWF), so he trained to become a professional wrestler, making his debut in 2008. He would go on to team with Kaplan in German Stampede Wrestling (GSW), and had greater success with Tarkan Aslan, as The Young Lions, winning multiple tag team championships across the country. Billed as Aslan's storyline brother, he was nicknamed The Lucky Kid, which later became his ring name.\n\nWestside Xtreme Wrestling (2015\u20132021) \nIn 2015, the Young Lions began making regular appearances in wXw, and upon their return in May 2017, they won the wXw World Tag Team Championship, aligning themselves with a new heel stable, Rise. Their reign lasted until November, as they failed to advance to the finals of the World Tag Team League. Rise eventually split into two factions, and Lucky aligned himself with the faces. Lucky would be involved in title shots for the wXw Shotgun Championship for much of the year, but in August 2018, Aslan turned his back on him. In autumn title matches against Marius Al-Ani, Aslan and Da Mack interfered on separate occasions, costing Lucky the match. This led to both factions facing off against each with the titles on the line, at Back to the Roots, which resulted in a win for the faces. At wXw 16 Carat Gold, Lucky defeated Ringkampf's Timothy Thatcher and Axel Dieter Jr., and 2017 winner Ilja Dragunov on his way to the final, before gaining an upset victory over Walter. He would remain a member of Rise until September 2019, as his match at Du Entscheidest with stablemate Pete Bouncer went to a no contest, and later in the night, Bouncer and Ivan Kiev made their mark in the tag division. In October, he began teaming with Kyle Fletcher as wXw's official representatives of Schadenfreude, a stable that originated in Fight Club: Pro (FCP). In 2020, Lucky was defeated in the first round of wXw 16 Carat Gold, and turned heel on night three, changing his ring name to his birth name, while introducing a new stable, Ezel, alongside Grup Anarsi (Abdul Kenan and Aytac Bahar).\n\nOn 30 May episode of Shotgun, Metehan explained the change in character, as it was necessary to provide for his family, especially his mother who was sick. He was also shown to have a short temper, due to being frustrated over Abdul and Aytac's performances in the ring. During July, he participated in a tournament for the vacant Shotgun Championship, and defeated Hektor Invictus in the final to win his first singles title in wXw. At a show in Kutenholz, Avalanche goaded Metehan into accepting a title shot by insulting his mother; Metehan defeated him later that night. The same tactic was used by Killer Kelly (who was the #1 contender for the Shotgun Championship) on 10 October episode of Shotgun, as he had no intention of hitting a woman, but since Kelly brought his mother into it, he had to defend her honour again, and quickly defeated Kelly by submission. Since wXw's return in the summer, Ezel and Die Raucherpause had come to an agreement that neither stable would interfere in each other's business, with Norman Harras often acting as the middleman. However, Metehan and Bobby Gunns were selected in the same block of the Catch Grand Prix, and would face each other in the final match. In his opening block match, Metehan was defeated by Cara Noir, when he flew into a rage after the Englishman used the taunt of his previous character against him. Over the course of the tournament, he went on to win his next four matches. The final block match between Metehan and Gunns resulted in a double disqualification, and although he tied the block alongside Noir with nine points, the opening match loss proved to be crucial and Noir made the final. On 31 December, at Silvester Spezial, Metehan was set to face an unknown challenger. Harras found out that director of sports Absolute Andy was out of the country at a fitness camp, so he hacked into Andy's iPad, and sent a e-mail to the board of directors, booking himself as the challenger for the Shotgun Championship. Andy soon learnt that his iPad had been hacked, and interrupted the match by video, to add a stipulation that the loser would be fined \u20ac5,000. With that threat looming over them, Harras eventually defeated Metehan, ending his reign at 154 days.\n\nWWE (2021\u20132022) \nOn 29 January 2021, it was reported that Kocaba\u015fo\u011flu had signed a contract with WWE, where he will perform on the NXT UK brand. A series of vignettes hyping his debut began on the 25 February episode of NXT UK, and on 4 March, his ring name on the brand was revealed to be Teoman. He made his debut on 11 March episode of NXT UK as a villain, defeating Danny Jones. On 24 June episode of NXT UK, Teoman defeated Oliver Carter and was joined by Rohan Raja, who stomped on Carter and aligned himself with Teoman.

{"eng_Latn":"Horrors is a supplement published by FASA in 1995 for the fantasy role-playing game Earthdawn.\n\nContents\nIn the world of Earthdawn, horrors are extra-dimensional astral creatures that ravaged the world for 400 years while humanity sheltered in underground cities.  Horrors, supposedly written by the sage Merrox, details the fifteen most powerful horrors, six of lesser power, and three monsters created by the horrors. The book also includes sixteen pages of color plates.\n\nProduction history\nFASA first produced the role-playing game Earthdawn in 1993. Horrors was the eighth supplement, published by FASA in 1995 as a 112-page softcover book written by Robin D. Laws, Teeuwynn Woodruff, Greg Gorden, Sam Witt, Allen Varney, Chris McCubbin, Caroline Spector, and Fraser Cain, with additional material by Louis J. Prosperi, Rob Cruz, Diane Piron-Gelman, Andrew Raglan, and Rich Warren. Black and white illustrations were created by Joel Biske, Kent Buries, Jeff Laubenstein, Larry MacDougall, Jim Nelson, Mike Nielsen, and Mark Tedin, and color plates were by Tom Baxa, Jeff Laubenstein, Jeff Miracola, and Nick Smith; Smith also created the cover art.\n\nReception\nIn the October 1995 edition of Dragon (Issue #222), Rick Swan admitted there was a already a plethora of fantasy monster collections on the market, but argued that this one was needed for the Earthdawn campaign because so little had been previously published about the horrors that are central to this role-playing game. Swan complimented the writing, which he found \"strong throughout\",. However he found many of the illustrations \"muddy and indistinct. Which, considering the stomach-churning physiognomy of some of these guys, may be a good thing.\"\n\nOther reviews\nRollespilsmagasinet F\u00f8nix, Issue 10 (October\/November 1995, p.56, in Danish)\nRingbote, Issue 13 (Jul\/Aug 1997, p.84, in German)\nEnvoyer, Issue 3 (Jan 1997, p.33, in German)\nRebel Times, Issue 52 (Jan 2012, p.38, in Polish)\nBackstab #8\nCasus Belli #89\n\nReferences\n\nEarthdawn supplements\nRole-playing game supplements introduced in 1995"}

{"eng_Latn":"The Open Notebook (TON) is a science journalism non-profit organization, online magazine, and publisher. Its purpose is to help science journalists improve their skills. It publishes articles and interviews on the craft of science writing and maintains a database of successful pitch letters to editors. TON also runs a paid fellowship program for early-career science journalists. The Open Notebook is supported by foundation grants and individual donations, and also partners with journalism and science communication organizations.\n\nDescription \nThe Open Notebook was founded as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization by freelance science journalists Siri Carpenter and Jeanne Erdmann.\n\nInitially, its sole purpose was to publish \"story-behind-the-story\" interviews with journalists about the genesis and development of specific published pieces of science journalism. Subjects of interviews at The Open Notebook have included Rebecca Skloot, Kathryn Schulz, Ed Yong, Mary Heglar, Elizabeth Kolbert, Steve Silberman, Adriana Gallardo, Carl Zimmer, Ankita Rao, Nicola Twilley, David Quammen, Christie Aschwanden, Elizabeth Shogren, Natalie Wolchover, Seth Mnookin, Cynthia Graber, and Gabriel Mac.\n\nIn 2011, Carpenter and Erdmann expanded the project to include a pitch database, an advice column, and articles on topics such as structuring narrative feature articles, finding and sharpening story ideas, taking good notes as a reporter, and pitching story ideas to editors.\n\nKnight Science Journalism at MIT wrote of the organization:\n\nGary Price of Library Journal said The Open Notebook \"provides unique tools and resources to help science journalists at all experience levels hone their craft\". Spencer Davis of The Freelancer by Contently said TON's site \"was built for science journalists in particular, but many of the site's resources are just as applicable to all freelance writers\".\n\nTara Haelle of the Association of Health Care Journalists wrote, \"Perhaps the best science journalism site\/blog out there is The Open Notebook, chock full of advice, tips, guides and inspiration.\" She listed the organization of topics on the site: \"Breaking In; Finding Ideas; Pitching; Story Planning and Reporting; Writing Accurately, Clearly and Engagingly; Fact-Checking, Self-Editing and Revising; The Business and Economics of Freelancing; Being Part of the Science Journalism World; and Looking for Inspiration?\"\n\nDavid Dobbs, writing in Wired, called TON \"The wonderful shop-talk site for science writers.\"\n\nArticles on science writing craft \nThe Open Notebook publishes articles focused on elements of science writing and editing craft. Topics include reporting on risk, reading scientific papers, covering preprint manuscripts, writing about disability, making freedom-of-information requests, being a science writer and managing a mental illness, finding and pitching stories to editors, negotiating freelance rates, and interviewing sources about trauma.\n\nThe Open Notebook partnered in 2016 with the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing (CASW) to co-publish Storygrams, a series of annotated articles analyzing exceptional qualities of notable science stories. Each piece in the series includes an in-depth embedded analysis of the story and an accompanying interview with its author. Undark summarized the project, \"The Storygrams project from The Open Notebook aims to highlight what makes the best science writing stand out.\" Articles examined through this series include works originally published in The New Yorker, The New York Times, National Geographic, Nature, The Atlantic, The New Republic, and other media outlets.\n\nWriter profiles \nIn the \"A Day in the Life\" series, The Open Notebook publishes brief profiles of working science journalists. In the series, writers and editors describe where they work, their favorite productivity and note-taking tools, their reading habits, and other aspects of their daily working routines. Spencer Davis wrote that the series \"resembles the New York Times s 'By the Book' column\u2014which interviews famous personalities on their reading and writing habits\u2014but with a focus on journalists\". Writers profiled through this series have included science journalists such as Maryn McKenna, Virginia Hughes, Nadia Drake, Amy Maxmen, Helen Ouyang, Anahad O'Connor, and Rhitu Chatterjee.\n\n Collections \nThe Open Notebook publishes several topical collections of articles on science journalism. Among others these include a collection of resources on diversity, equity, and inclusion in science writing. The collection includes a resource page to assist journalists in finding diverse science sources and a collection of diversity style guides for journalists. It also offers the article series \"Diverse Voices in Science Journalism,\" which is published in collaboration with the National Association of Science Writers (NASW) Diversity Committee. The series has included articles on subjects such as covering indigenous communities, dealing with harassment from sources, including LGBTQ+ scientists as sources, navigating newsrooms as a minority, decolonizing science writing in South Africa, and working with a sensitivity reader.\n\n Pitch database \nThe Open Notebook'''s pitch database includes more than 200 successful pitch letters for news and feature stories to help writers gain better understanding of what makes a pitch most likely to succeed. Spencer Davis wrote, \"Sections like the Pitch Database, which publishes successful pitches submitted by real journalists, can be extremely useful for figuring out what works and what doesn't.\" When The Open Notebook published its first book, The Craft of Science Writing, in 2020, some pitches from the pitch database were included in annotated form. In that piece, journalist Roxanne Khamsi pointed out well-executed elements of certain pitch letters, discussing what makes those elements important and that likely contributed to their success.\n\n Early-career fellowships \nThe organization started a fellowship program in 2013 for early-career science journalists. Through this program, fellows report and write articles on the craft of science writing for publication at The Open Notebook. Some alumni of the program include Tina Casagrand, Ti\u00ean Nguy\u1ec5n, Aneri Pattani, Julia Rosen, Christina Selby, Jane C. Hu, Rodrigo P\u00e9rez Ortega, Rachel Zamzow, Geoffrey Giller, Knvul Sheikh, Jennifer Lu, Shira Feder, and Katherine J. Wu.\n\n Spanish translations \nIn 2019, The Open Notebook began translating some of its reported features into Spanish. The TON en Espa\u00f1ol Spanish translation series includes articles such as reporting on preprint manuscripts, spotting shady statistics in scientific papers, solutions journalism for science reporters, and the shortage of Spanish-language science journalism in the U.S.\n\n Science Storytellers \nIn 2017, The Open Notebook became a partner with, and fiscal sponsor of, Science Storytellers, an organization that helps children interview scientists using tools of science journalism. This organization, founded by science writer Jennifer Cutraro, operates booths at science fairs and festivals, including at the American Association for the Advancement of Science's annual Family Science Days and at the American Chemical Society's ACS Kids Zone event.\n\n Peeps science diorama contest \nIn 2019, The Open Notebook hosted the first annual science-themed Peeps diorama contest. The project was the idea of Helen Fields, Kate Ramsayer and Joanna Fields, who had participated in past Peeps diorama contests hosted by The Washington Post and other publications. From 50 entries, winners included dioramas depicting, in Peeps, NASA's Hidden Figures, a virology laboratory, the National Museum of Natural History, and other scientific themes.\n\n Contributors \nContributors to The Open Notebook have included writers such as Nadia Drake, Ed Yong, Carl Zimmer, Laura Helmuth, Kendra Pierre-Louis, Sharon Begley, Tasneem Raja, Michelle Nijhuis, Anil Ananthaswamy , Melinda Wenner Moyer, Shraddha Chakradhar, Tom Yulsman, Olga Kreimer, Roxanne Khamsi, Brooke Borel, Mara Hvistendahl, George Musser, Azeen Ghorayshi, Sandeep Ravindran, and Charles Seife.\n\n Funding The Open Notebook is supported by individual contributions and by grants from charitable foundations.

{"eng_Latn":"Hoodoo Love is a play by American playwright and producer Katori Hall. It debuted off-Broadway at Cherry Lane Theater in 2007 and has been produced in other metropolitan areas in the years since. The Great Depression-era play tells the story of an aspiring singer in Memphis, Toulou, who seeks help with her personal life from a local hoodoo practitioner. The play received mixed critical reception after its initial release and received more positive reviews for later productions.\n\nSynopsis \nSet in 1933 in Memphis, aspiring singer Toulou seeks help from an elderly neighbor, Candylady, to secure the love of her restless musician boyfriend. Candylady performs hoodoo to help her, after which her born-again Christian brother re-enters her life.\n\nCast\n\nOriginal run (2007) \n Angela Lewis as Toulou\n Marjorie Johnson as Candylady\n Kevin Mambo as Ace of Spades\n Keith Davis as Jib\n\n2017 (Seattle) and 2019 (Chicago) \n Martasia Jones as Toulou\n Shariba Rivers as Candylady\n Matthew James Elam as Ace of Spades\n Christopher Wayland Jones as Jib\n\nProduction \nHall developed the play through Cherry Lane's Mentor Project under the mentorship of Lynn Nottage. It debuted off-Broadway at Cherry Lane Theater from November 1, 2007 - December 9, 2007. Hoodoo Love is Hall's debut play. \n\nIt has had several other productions throughout the years in other cities including Los Angeles (2012) Seattle (2017), and Chicago (2019).\n\nCritical reception \nThe show received mixed critical reception after its initial off-Broadway run. Writing for The Village Voice, Tom Sellar stated: \"And this debut play...has several evocative moments\u2014especially when it delves into hoodoo, an African-American folk magic, which Hall uses to conjure her drama\u2019s most compelling scenes.

It shows Ms. Hall as a strong presence who is still working out how to articulate what it is that she wants to say.\"\n\nHoodoo Love's later productions received more positive reviews. David C. Nichols stated in the Los Angeles Times in 2012, \"Admittedly, her debut script sports some clich\u00e9s and arbitrary plotting amid the pre-PC patois and imaginative interstitial songs -- musical director Haskel Joseph's live guitar licks are worth admission -- yet it fascinates us despite its flaws.\" Sara Porkalob wrote about the 2017 Seattle production for The Stranger, \"What I had seen was full, moving, and blooded with real people, a celebration of Black resilience running through it.\" In a review for Chicago Tribune in 2019, Chris Jones rated the play 3\/4 stars and wrote: \"The set doesn\u2019t free up the strongest, central part of the stage and, frankly, the constantly swinging screen doors end up as a distraction. But the visual finale that these two artists pull off in this small space is pretty spectacular...and each performer here is diving deep into a difficult work, richly staged.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Official website\n\nPlays about religion and science\n2007 plays\nPlays set in the 1930s\nOff-Broadway plays\nAfrican-American plays\nHoodoo (spirituality)\nFiction about magic"}

{"eng_Latn":"Guia da Sec\u00e7\u00e3o Hist\u00f3rica do Museu Paulista () is a guide book written by the historian and museum director Afonso d'Escragnolle Taunay. It is the first comprehensive description of the Museu do Ipiranga, commonly known as the Paulista Museum, in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. It solidified the emphasis on historical materials in the museum, a position promoted by Taunay over his long tenure. The publication outlines the history, exhibition rooms and areas, and research conducted by the museum.\n\nThe Guia was published in 1937 by the S\u00e3o Paulo Imprensa Official do Estado. Apart from a description of the museum, it contains photographic plates and a composition and arrangement of museum spaces and permanent exhibitions.\n\nThe Guia da Sec\u00e7\u00e3o Hist\u00f3rica do Museu Paulista is seen as a response to the work of Rodolpho von Ihering (1883-1939), the Guia das Colecc\u00f5es do Museu Paulista (), published in 1907. Rodolpho von Ihering emphasized the natural history collections of the museum, and placed little attention on its historical collections. Rodolpho was the son of the director of the Paulista Museum, Hermann von Ihering (1850-1930), who directed the museum from 1895 to 1916. Von Ihering, due to his German background, was dismissed from his position of director of the Museu Paulista in 1917 upon Brazil's entry into World War I on the Allied side.\n\nTaunay, as a historian and director of the museum from 1917 to 1945, disagreed with the focus of his predecessor and redesigned the Paulista Museum primarily as a history museum. Taunay used the guide to describe \"in detail the symbolic meaning of each element\" of the interior of the Museum. The Guia da Sec\u00e7\u00e3o Hist\u00f3rica do Museu Paulista solidified his position on history and removed most references to the natural science collection of the museum. Only at the end of the work, in a few lines, did Tauney describe that the museum had twelve rooms dedicated to zoology, two to botany, and one of mineralogy and paleontology.\n\nReferences\n\nMuseu do Ipiranga\n1937 non-fiction books\nBrazilian non-fiction books"}

He started his career in the Forest Service, in wildlife management, and nearly two decades later transferred to the National Park Service.\n\nHe is the former superintendent of Boston National Historical Park and Boston African American National Historic Site. In 2015 he was selected as the first African American superintendent of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the most visited national park in the United States welcoming 12.5 million visitors in 2019.\n\nEarly life and education\nCash was born in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1968, to a father who worked as a police officer in the Memphis Police Department, and a mother who worked as a cosmetologist.\n\nCash attributes some of his earliest interest in the natural world to watching Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom documentary television series in his family home. His interest was further solidified through participating in outdoor excursions with Memphis Boy Scouts Troop 511.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in Memphis, Cash earned a bachelor of science degree in biology from the historically black college, the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, and later studied wildlife management at Oregon State University. Cash is a member of Phi Beta Sigma and Sigma Pi Phi, Beta Theta Chapter.\n\nCareer\nCash began his federal career in 1991 with the United States Forest Service as a wildlife biologist at the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington State. He went on to work with the US Forest Service for 18 years in various leadership positions. He served as an administrative officer at Nebraska National Forest, district ranger at the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest, a civil rights officer at the National Forests in Mississippi, and was the deputy forest supervisor at the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest in southern Oregon before leaving the Forest Service to join the National Park Service in 2010.\n\nCash served as superintendent at Boston National Historical Park and Boston African American National Historical Park from 2010 to early 2015. While there, he worked with the City of Boston to open a new visitor center in historic Faneuil Hall, which now welcomes more than 5 million visitors a year. Cash also worked with several park partners to secure $4 million to reopen the African Meeting House, the oldest Black church still in its original location in the country. He and his team worked to rebrand Boston's Freedom Trail and the Black Heritage Trail as the Boston Trail to Freedom in order to merge the histories of the American Revolution and history of abolition and to \u201chighlight Boston\u2019s \u2018total\u2019 contribution\u201d to US history. In 2014, Cash served as the deputy regional director and chief of staff in the National Park Service Northeast Regional Office. By the end of his five years of service in Boston, Cash was noted as having made \u201ca significant impact\u201d during his term as superintendent there.\n\nIn late 2014, National Park Service Regional Director Stan Austin named Cash as the superintendent of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Cash stepped into the Smokies superintendent position in February 2015, taking over after a series of acting superintendents and the earlier departure of the park's previous permanent superintendent, Dale Ditmanson, who retired in January 2014. \u00a0In 2017, Cash also served a temporary assignment as acting superintendent of National Mall and Memorial parks in Washington, DC, for 120 days.\n\nSince arriving in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Superintendent Cash has managed the park through a number of notable events including the disastrous Chimney Tops 2 Fire, the 2016 National Park Service Centennial, and Smokies Centennial Hike 100 challenge, the 2018 completion of the \u2018Missing Link\u2019 of the Foothills Parkway, and the 2020 arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2022, Superintendent Cash introduced a ground-breaking proposal that would address the financial needs of the park as its visitation has consistently increased by 57% over a ten-year period, while working with a flat budget and a declining workforce. \n\nThe initiative, called \u201cPark it Forward,\u201d proposed having visitors purchase a parking tag when recreating within the park. Though controversial in some surrounding communities, the \u2018Park it Forward\u2019 parking tag program was approved on April 4, 2022\u00a0with the support of the majority of the national public. \u00a0\n\nThe parking tag requirement will go in effect March 1, 2023. It is predicted that the program will generate between $6-8 million in its first year of implementation, with 100% of the revenue staying in the park. Several long-time supporters, including former Senator Alexander of Tennessee, have personally shared with superintendent Cash, \u201cThe Park it Forward initiative will be as impactful as it was for when Great Smoky Mountains National Park was created.\u201d\n\nAwards \nOn May 24, 2021, Cash received the Agency Leadership Award from the Public Lands Alliance.\n\nOn October 21, 2021, Cash received the National Park Conservation Association's 2021 Stephen Tyng Mather Award.

His father had a doctorate in psychology and worked as Director of Libraries of the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education; his mother was a painter. He was educated at the Stanislaus Kostka Gymansium in Warsaw (1938).\n\nDuring his second year of college, at the outset of the Second World War, Ziembi\u0144ski enlisted in the Home Army resistance movement, then received a commission as podporucznik in the 27th Home Army Infantry Regiment. He saw much action, taking part in the Silent Unseen's Operation Freston (1945).\n\nAcademic career \nIn 1947, he graduated in law from University of Pozna\u0144's Faculty of Law and Administration, having written Master of Jurisprudence (M.Jur.) thesis under the supervision of Czes\u0142aw Znamierowski, who introduced Ziembi\u0144ski to the field of Legal Theory and convinced him to major in the subject. In 1949 he completed his Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) degree in sociology at the University of Pozna\u0144 under the supervision of Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.

The theory served as a base for the development of so-called normative concept of sources of law. Ziembi\u0144ski defined law as a system of norms of conduct distinguishable from other social norms by determined formal features. Another ideas suggested by him were the differentiation between a legal norm and a legal provision, as well as the conception of two coupled norms and the notion of a norm of competence.\n\nHe was a member of the Polish Philosophical Society, Polish Sociological Association, Pozna\u0144 Society for the Advancement of Arts and Sciences, International Association for the Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy (IVR) and served as a vice president of the International Association of Legal Methodology.\n\nIn 1991, Ziembi\u0144ski became a corresponding member of the Polish Academy of Sciences.\n\nHonours and awards \n\n  : Home Army Cross (1975)\n  : Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (1994)\n : The City of Pozna\u0144 Excellence in Science Award for his series of publications on basic issues of law and ethics (1996)\n\nReferences \n\n1920 births\n1996 deaths\nPhilosophers of law\n20th-century Polish philosophers"}

{"eng_Latn":"The One Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results (stylized The ONE Thing) is a non-fiction self-help book written by authors and real estate entrepreneurs Gary W. Keller and Jay Papasan. The book discusses the value of simplifying one's workload by focusing on the one most important task in any given project. The book has appeared on the bestseller lists of The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and Amazon.com. It was first published by Bard Press on April 1, 2013.\n\nBackground\n\nGary Keller is the co-founder and chairman of the board at Keller Williams Realty, which is one of the world's largest real estate companies. Jay Papasan is the Vice President of publishing at Keller Williams. Prior to the publication of The One Thing in 2013, the two collaborated on The Millionaire Real Estate series of books which discussed how to invest in and earn money from real estate properties. The One Thing is the duo's first book that is not specifically focused on real estate. Instead, it discusses the general business principle of choosing a single task to work on to theoretically maximize the efficiency of that task and the overall project.\n\nSummary\n\nThe book discusses the benefits of prioritizing a single task, and it also provides examples of how to engage in those tasks with a singular focus. The book begins with a section entitled, \"The Lies: They Mislead and Derail Us\", which analyzes the ways in which multitasking has erroneously been praised as a desirable trait. The authors also challenge the concept of \"work-life balance\", calling it \"[i]dealistic, but not realistic.\" They concluded this section by quoting that \u201cSuccess isn\u2019t a game won by whoever does the most\u201d and believe that the majority of what we want will come from the minority of what we do. \n\nThis then leads to the \"Focusing Question\" which asks \"What's the ONE Thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?\" This second section of the book deals with productivity principles like habit-building and benchmarking. For instance, the book suggests that readers should engage in four hours of work on their \"ONE thing\" each day. The authors cite economist Vilfredo Pareto as one of the inspirations behind this philosophy. Pareto's principle suggested that 20 percent of the effort produces 80 percent of the results. According to the book, this means that engaging in the one most important task will be more likely to produce the desired results without any extraneous effort. The book also differentiates between the Big-Picture Question (\"What's my ONE Thing?\") and the Small-Focus Question (\"What's my ONE Thing right now?\"). The core idea is that focusing on an excessive amount of tasks will more likely lead to discord and under-performance.\n\nThe third section of the book discusses \"Extraordinary Results\", which details how to make the above principles actionable. One of the concepts it illustrates is \"time blocking\", which means that one should focus on only their one thing during a given amount of time. It also suggests that readers should schedule time to reflect, plan, and even relax. Everything else during scheduled time blocks is characterized as a distraction. Each section of the book is followed up by a \"Big Ideas\" review that gives a summary of the sections' concepts and principles.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe One Thing garnered success both critically and commercially. It was listed as a best seller by The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and Amazon.com. Hudson Booksellers listed it among their best \"Business Interest\" books of 2013. In an article for Entrepreneur, Brandon Turner named The One Thing one of the \"5 Powerful Books That Changed the Direction of My Life\". In a review for The National, Alice Haine notes that the book \"has the necessary ingredients to boost those feeling a little overwhelmed by the pressures of work and home life.\" Publishers Weekly noted that book had \"an appealing style and energy.\" It has won a total of 12 book awards and been translated into 26 languages. It was also voted one of the Top 100 Business Books of All Time on Goodreads.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n The One Thing | Gary keller & Jay Papasan | Book Review\n\n2013 non-fiction books\nAmerican non-fiction books\nBusiness books\nSelf-help books"}

{"eng_Latn":"Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), also known as the mitochondrial outer membrane permeability, is one of two ways apoptosis (programmed cell death) can be activated. It is part of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, also known as the mitochondrial pathway. MOMP is known as the point of no return in apoptosis. Once triggered, it results in the diffusion of proteins from the space between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes into the cytosol.\n\nMechanism\nInitiation of MOMP involves Bcl-2 family proteins, including BAX and BAK. The outer mitochondrial membrane, typically permeable to molecules smaller than 5 kDa, forms pores during MOMP that allow it to accommodate proteins larger than 100 kDa. During MOMP, it takes about five minutes for all mitochondrial membranes within a cell to permeabilize.\n\nOutcome\nMOMP has been referred to as the point of no return for apoptosis, almost always resulting in the completion of the process, and thus, cell death. However, in limited circumstances, apoptosis does not complete. Sometimes, MOMP does not complete, known as incomplete MOMP (iMOMP) or minority MOMP (miniMOMP).

{"eng_Latn":"SocialChorus, Inc. is an American multinational software company headquartered in San Francisco, California, that designs, develops and sells workforce communications software. Its platform helps large companies manage communications with employees and partners. Greg Shove and Nicole Alvino founded the company in 2008 and Gary Nakamura serves as CEO.\n\nHistory\n\n2008\u20132013: Founding and early years \nGreg Shove and Nicole Alvino met at Stanford Graduate School of Business, where Greg was an advisor in one of Nicole's classes. They formed SocialChorus in 2008. In its early years, the company operated as Halogen Media Group and focused on helping companies run online marketing campaigns. It grew following a Series A round of financing from Kohlberg Ventures in 2009, and in 2011 the company renamed to SocialChorus following a merger with influencer management platform YouCast.\n\nBlogs and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter were emerging into mainstream culture at the time and large companies were beginning to communicate product releases, company news and promotions with bloggers, customers and employees who expressed an interest in talking about their products and services online. SocialChorus built a platform that helped companies run and measure these advocate marketing campaigns at a larger scale. Early clients included AT&T, Toyota and Peet's Coffee, and in 2013 the company secured $2.5 Million in Series A funding from existing investor Kohlberg Ventures and a new investor, Windforce Ventures.\n\n2013\u20132016: Evolution into employee advocacy \nThe SocialChorus platform was originally built to help companies engage with influential consumers but AT&T, one of the earliest users of SocialChorus, found that its own employees were interested in talking about the company online. AT&T used SocialChorus to form an employee social media advocacy program called AT&T Social Circle. Thousands of AT&T employees connected their personal social media accounts to the platform to receive company information and publish it out to their own friends, family members and professional networks. Interest in this new model of tapping employees as brand ambassadors grew, prompting SocialChorus to focus its platform on helping companies scale employee advocacy programs. Kohlberg Ventures led additional rounds of funding in 2014 and 2016.\n\n2016\u2013present: Growth into workforce communications platform \nBy the mid 2010s, large companies had amassed a range of disparate tools to communicate with their employees\u2014from digital signage in office hallways to internal email newsletters, intranets and internal social networks and chat tools. As companies took on digital transformation projects and started to place more emphasis on employee communications, SocialChorus evolved its product into a workforce communications platform designed to align communications across these disparate internal channels. TechCrunch described it as a \"platform to help organizations coordinate and communicate better with their employees.\" It raised an additional $12.5 million in 2018 to fund development of integrations with SharePoint, Slack and Workplace, as well as expansion into Europe, Middle East and Africa with an additional office opened in London.\n\nReferences \n\nCompanies based in San Francisco\nSoftware companies established in 2008\nSoftware companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area\nSoftware companies of the United States\n2008 establishments in California"}

{"eng_Latn":"The western pygmy marmoset (Cebuella pygmaea) is a marmoset species, a very small New World monkey found in the northwestern Amazon rainforest in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. It was formerly regarded as conspecific with the similar eastern pygmy marmoset, which has whitish underparts. Although the western pygmy marmoset occurs further west than the eastern pygmy marmoset, the primary separators of their ranges are the Amazon River (Solim\u00f5es River) and Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River, with the western occurring to the north of them and the eastern to the south.\n\nPhysical description \nThe western pygmy marmoset is the worlds smallest monkey. Pygmy marmosets have only a slight degree of sexual dimorphism; in the wild the average male weighs , which is slightly smaller than the average female at . Fully grown western pygmy marmosets have an average body length of , and a tail marked with black rings that is on average longer than their bodies at . They have fluffy \"brownish-gold fur with black ticking on their shoulders, backs, and heads, while their ventral fur is light yellow to white\". There is very little visible physical differences between the two species in the Cebuella genus, with only a slight distinction in pelage colour. Similar to other New World monkey species, the Western pygmy marmoset has long claw-like nails on all of their digits, which are mainly used for climbing and foraging. Their skull is similar to that of the Callithrix genus, possibly due to their tree-gouging behavior and their appendicular skeleton has been shaped by the long periods of clinging, climbing, and their \"upside down and under branch locomotion\". While pygmy marmosets leap the farthest relative to the length of their bodies, they are not very efficient in their leaps, and thus rarely do.\n\nDistribution \nWestern pygmy marmosets are native to South America, occupying a range which intersects borders with Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In Brazil, they can be found in the upper Amazon basin, north of Solim\u00f5es River, west of the Japur\u00e1 River and south of the R\u00edo Caquet\u00e1 in Colombia. There is a small subpopulation which is isolated west of the Rio Huallaga in northern Peru, which are of concern to researchers, as anthropogenic stresses are threatening this small population. They prefer a lowland habitat within tropical forests that are flooded for more than three months per year. Thus, their habitats are in tropical climates within swamps or rainforests.\n\nBehaviour\n\nDiet \nThe western pygmy marmoset is an exudativore-insectivore, thus its diet comes mainly from the exudates (fluids) from trees, such as tree sap, gum, and latex from lianas and trees. Through evolution of feeding on gum and sap from trees, the western pygmy marmoset developed dental adaptations that its ancestors did not have. These dental adaptations allow it to actively stimulate the fluids from the trees, as it gouges holes in the bark. It can also be found, on occasion, eating arthropods and fruits.\n\nBreeding \nThe pygmy marmosets frequently have fraternal twins. When born, their infants are smaller than expected compared to their gestation length. This is probably due to their slow growth rate when in utero.\n\nStudies have shown that Cebuella pygmaea is potentially able to prevent reproduction in their population through hormonal suppression. If a single dominant female marmoset does not wish for her subordinate group members to reproduce, she can produce pheromonal signals which suppress hormones (LH secretion) which leads to ovulatory failure. However, this does not always work. If a subordinate female group member succeeds at breeding, the dominant female might resort to killing the offspring.\n\nVocalizations \nDue to the natural habitat in the dense Amazonian River basin, the western pygmy marmoset must rely on vocal communication. This marmoset uses trills when it is at close distance, up to , from one another and they use J calls when they are more than  apart. The western pygmy marmoset\u2019s \u201chabitat acoustics have shaped the physical structure of the signals used for short and long-range communication\u201d. Long-range calls are the only ones that are distinctively heard compared to the trills and J calls, as they produce a lower frequency call at long distances. By using these different calling methods, the pygmy marmoset has developed a way of communicating distances to determine individual locations.\n\nInterestingly, the western pygmy marmoset has been observed to change \u201cthe structure of their trill vocalizations in response to pairing with a new mate\u201d. Prior to mating, marmosets would display unique trill vocalizations, and after six weeks of pairing, their trills become more homogenous. These same studies also show that these vocal structure changes remained stable three years after pairing.\n\nThreats and conservation \nAs of 2015, the western pygmy marmoset (Cebuella pygmaea) has been listed by the IUCN as vulnerable based on the A4cd criteria. Based on their assessments, the population has declined more than 30% since 2009. According to the IUCN, this population decline can be attributed mainly to anthropogenic threats including deforestation, agriculture, mining and settlements. While the distribution area of the western pygmy marmoset is physically large, their niche diet results in a significantly smaller suitable habitat within the area they inhabit. Furthermore, this species has been impacted by the exotic pet trade, specifically in areas of their range which coincide with Ecuador and Peru. Hunting has also traditionally been a stressor to the pygmy marmoset populations, as live capture is a common practice of children and adults of many indigenous communities, as well as being eaten and killed for target practice.\n\nWhile the western pygmy marmoset is only listen by the IUCN as vulnerable and not yet endangered, many scholars believe that more is needed to protect these animals. Some conservation methods include programs based \u201con didactic game through which children learn about the ecology, behaviour and conservation of these small primates\u201d with the goal of increasing awareness in order to help preserve pygmy marmosets and their habitats. De La Torre and Morelos-Juarez believe that educating local communities can have positive long-term effects on conservation. For instance, they produced environmental education programs where the intention was to provide children with the tools to be able to reflect how their actions can affect the environment. De La Torre and Morelos-Juarez also have an initiative called \u201cteaching teachers\u201d where teachers were taught to create lessons on the environment and primate protection had positive results among children. Both authors however elude to the fact that empowering and educating local communities is not enough to protect the pygmy marmoset populations.\n\nReferences\n\nCebuella\nMammals described in 1823\nPrimates of South America\nTaxa named by Johann Baptist von Spix"}

{"eng_Latn":"A. M. Nandakumar is an Indian film director and screenwriter who has worked on Tamil films. He made his debut with the 2003 action drama film, Thennavan starring Vijaykanth and Kiran Rathod.\n\nCareer\nAfter working as an assistant director for several years to P. Vasu, Manivannan and Rajasekar, Nandakumar successfully pitched the story of Kodiesvaran to producer K. T. Kunjumon. After initially considering either Vijay or Ajith Kumar for the lead role, the team went ahead with the producer's son, Eby Kunjumon. The film started production in 1997 with Eby appearing alongside Simran, with Hindi actress Karisma Kapoor making a guest appearance in an item number. The film's music album and trailer were released in early 1999, but Kunjumon's financial troubles meant that the film failed to have a theatrical release. If released, the film would have been among the highest budgeted films of the time. As the film became stuck, Nandakumar worked on a Japanese film titled Dancing with Ninja shot in Chennai.\n\nNandakumar moved on and worked on another script titled Aasan. He approached Vijayakanth to work on the film, but during the narration, it became clear that the script had been already pitched to the actor as Ramana by AR Murugadoss. Following the confusion, Vijayakanth apologetically called Nandakumar to make another film with him titled Thennavan (2003). The film opened to mixed reviews, with a critic from The Hindu noting \"Thennavan would have been a tailor made story for Vijayakanth but for the flawed script, clich\u00e9d dialogue and unappealing caricatures. Somewhere down the line everyone from the director (M. Nandakumaran) and the hero seem to have lost interest.\"\n\nNandakumar announced Jambhavan (2006) in December 2005 and began production shortly after a launch event held in Tirupathi. Prashanth was signed to play the lead role, while Nila and Meghna Naidu were signed to portray the film's lead heroines. The team began shoot with a thirty-day schedule in Tenkasi in Southern Tamil Nadu. The making of the film was disrupted in January 2006, when actress Nila briefly walked out of the film after falling out with the producers. The film opened in September 2006 and received predominantly negative reviews. A critic from Sify.com noted \"this film is a slapdash enterprise that will make you groan\", adding \"it caters strictly to B and C class audiences and leaves you cold\". Another reviewer noted the similarity to Baashha (1995) adding \"the quality of these remakes has ranged from entertaining to outright bad and Prashanth's Jaambavan unfortunately comes in at the lower end of that scale.\" Indiaglitz.com also noted the similarity adding \"director Nandakumar has taken cue from a few 'mass films', but just has not managed to cobble them with any sense of purpose.\"\n\nIn 2014, Nandakumar made Kalkandu and the film gained media attention prior to release, owing to the lead actor Gajesh's debut. The actor was the son of actor-dancer Anand Babu and grandson of comedian Nagesh. Following the appearance of late actor Nagesh's animation in Kochadaiiyaan (2014), Nandakumar insisted on having a sequence in his film, where all three generations of the family appear in one scene through computer imagery. The film was shot mainly in Tamil Nadu, in places such as Tiruchi and Kanyakumari. The film had a limited release in October 2014, owing to the presence of bigger budget films at the box office. It opened to mixed reviews with a critics noting the film \"gets stuck towards average.\" Another reviewer noted that the film had a dated feel and called it \"excruciatingly long\".\n\nFilmography\n\nFilms\n\nTelevision\n\nReferences\n\nLiving people\n20th-century Indian film directors\nTamil film directors\nYear of birth missing (living people)\nTamil screenwriters"}

On Friday 10 July, before the primaries on the weekends, police raided the office of co-organisers Public Opinion Research Institute (PORI), taking away computers and accusing the organisation of dishonest use of a computer. PORI director Robert Chung said that the primaries will still be held, and computers related to the primaries were not taken away.\n\nLaw enforcement\nIn a statement, the Hong Kong Police Force said that they would consider illegal any flag or banner raised by protesters deemed to be promoting Hong Kong's separation from China, along with Tibetan, Xinjiang and Taiwan independence. The police was granted new powers, including the ability to conduct searches for evidence without a warrant in \"exceptional circumstances\", to restrict persons suspected of violating the national security law from leaving Hong Kong, and to take down electronic messages published that are \"likely to constitute an offence endangering national security or is likely to cause the occurrence of an offence endangering national security\".\n\nOn 1 July, the police used a new banner to warn protesters against \"displaying flags or banners\/chanting slogans\/or conducting yourselves with an intent such as secession or subversion, which may constitute offenses\u201d under the new law, and that they \u201cmay be arrested and prosecuted.\u201d On 2 July, the Hong Kong government issued a statement declaring the slogan \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\" as having separatist and subversive connotations, and that it may seek to prosecute those displaying or chanting the slogan under the new law.\n\nThe Office for Safeguarding National Security of the CPG in the HKSAR was established as a state security agency on 1 July. The Office, together with its employees' living quarters, is located in the Metropark Hotel Causeway Bay Hong Kong building. Separately, the Department for Safeguarding National Security, under the Police Force, was established on the same day.\n\nArrests and charges\nThe first arrest under the national security law was made on 1 July, less than 15 hours after the text for the law was published. A man was arrested for allegedly holding a Hong Kong independence flag in Causeway Bay. On the same day, nine others were arrested on suspicion of violating the national security law. They included people who were calling for independence, or possessing items advocating independence.\n\nOn 3 July, a man arrested on 1 July who allegedly drove a motorbike into a group of three police officers while flying a \u201cLiberate Hong Kong\u201d banner was charged with one count of inciting secession and another of terrorism. He became the first person to be formally charged under the new law. His case was also the first case involving the National Security Law to reach trial. \n\nOn 6 July, 2 more were arrested under the national security law during a protest where protesters held out blank papers. A person, calling the police \"dirty cops\", was warned that they were in violation of the new law.\n\nPolitical exiles since the enactment\n\nNathan Law \nOn 2 July 2020, Nathan Law posted on his social media page that he has left Hong Kong. Later it was known that Law settled in the United Kingdom.\n\nTed Hui \nOn 3 December 2020, Ted Hui, while in Denmark, announced that he would not return to Hong Kong.\n\nCultural\nOn 4 July, it was discovered that at least nine books authored or co-authored by pro-democratic figures, including Joshua Wong and Tanya Chan, have been removed from public libraries. The Leisure and Cultural Services Department, responsible for running the libraries, said in a statement that the libraries \"will review whether certain books violate the stipulations of the National Security Law,\" and that \"while legal advice will be sought in the process of the review, the books will not be available for borrowing and reference in libraries.\" Before the law was enacted, exhibitors of the 2020 Hong Kong Book Fair, to be opened on 15 July, were urged by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, the organiser, to exercise \u201cself-discipline\u201d and avoid selling \u201cunlawful\u201d books. After the law was enacted and books removed from libraries, some exhibitors have stated that they will not sell the books that are being reviewed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department.\n\nLocal magazine Breakazine stopped the publication of its July issue, as the publisher seeks legal opinion on whether the latest issue would be in violation of the new law. Political commentator Koo Tak Ming ended his regular contributions to Apple Daily in response to the new law.\n\nEducation\nOn 3 July, Hong Kong Education Bureau sent a late night notice to all schools in Hong Kong demanding that the newly enacted national security legislation will be taught and enforced in all public and private schools, including special education schools, in every single grade level starting in Kindergarten. The Bureau will support developing curriculum and assessment, the notice stated, and requests all stake holders \u2013 educators, administrators, social workers \u2013 work together to \"enhance national identity\". On 6 July, the Education Bureau has ordered schools to review and remove items from their curriculum and libraries that violate the newly enacted national security law, unless these books are to \"positively teach\" students. Critics of the national security law have long seen the national security law as a tool to silence dissent. The Education Bureau further reaffirmed to Reuters that because schools are the \"gatekeepers\" for their teaching resources, therefore school management and teachers should review \"all teaching materials, including books\" that may violate the national security law.\n\nOn 8 July, Education Bureau minister Kevin Yeung stated in a written response that pro-democracy protest-related activities such as forming human chains or chanting songs, specifically the protest anthem \"Glory to Hong Kong\", are banned in all schools. Whereas Article 27 of Hong Kong Basic Law guarantees citizens' freedom of speech, of \"assembly, of procession and of demonstration\", Yeung concluded that children's right to free expression \"is not absolute\" and requested that schools take action to prevent such \"violations\" from occurring.\n\nTechnological\nIn response to the law, Facebook, Google, Twitter, WhatsApp and Telegram temporarily paused the processing of government requests for user data in Hong Kong, while video-sharing platform TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, announced its discontinuation of Hong Kong operations.\n\nSee also \n Timeline of reactions to the Hong Kong national security law\n October, November, December 2020\n January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September\u2013November 2021\n\nReferences\n\nPolitics of Hong Kong\nHong Kong national security law"}
{"eng_Latn":"The Emporia Nationals were a minor league baseball team based in Emporia, Virginia. From 1948 to 1951, Emporia played as members of the Class D level Virginia League, winning the 1950 league Championship. The Emporia Nationals were a minor league affiliate of the Washington Senators (today's Minnesota Twins). The team played as the \"Rebels\" in 1951, with Emporia hosting minor league home games at Slagle Stadium.\n\nHistory\nIn 1947, the Washington Senators had the fewest number of minor league affiliates (6) and scouts (3) of any major-league team. Owner Clark Griffith named former player Ossie Bluege as Farm Director and expanded the Washington system to 11 minor league affiliates and 7 scouts in 1948. One of Bluege\u2019s goals was to establish a Class D level affiliate in the Middle Atlantic region, when several other teams were seeking to turn the semipro Virginia League into a minor league, which proved to be successful. Local businessman Eugene Bloom was instrumental in reaching an agreement with the Senators to place a team in Emporia. Griffith then named Bloom as business manager of the Emporia team.\n \nIn 1948, the Emporia \"Nationals\" became members of the Virginia League, which reformed as a six\u2013team, Class D level league. The Blackstone Barristers, Franklin Cubs, Lawrenceville Cardinals, Petersburg Generals and Suffolk Goobers teams joined Emporia in beginning league play on April 23, 1948.\n\nThe Emporia Nationals began play as a minor league affiliate of the Washington Senators. The franchise would continue the affiliation through the 1950 season.\n\nIn their first season of play, the Emporia Nationals missed the 1948 Virginia League playoffs. The Nationals ended the regular season with a record of 63\u201374, placing 5th in the standings, finishing 21.0 games behind the first place Suffolk Goobers. Morrie Aderholt served as player\/manager, his first of three seasons as player\/manager. Aderholt won the league batting title with a .387 batting average and hit a league leading 31 home runs.\n\nIn their second season, the Nationals qualified for the Virginia League playoffs in 1949. Playing under returning manager Morrie Aderholt, Emporia ended the 1949 season with a record of 67\u201355 and placed third the regular season standings, finishing 10.0 games behind the first place Franklin Kildees. Emporia was the only league team with a major league affiliation in 1949, after the league had three in 1948. In the 1st round of the playoffs, the Petersburg Generals defeated the Nationals in seven games.  John Garrison of Emporia led the league with 25 home runs.\n\nJust before the start of the regular season, Emporia pitchers Bert Roseberry and Ralph Fraser were both killed in an automobile accident. Their deaths occurred during spring training on April 15, 1950, two weeks before opening day.\n\nThe 1950 Emporia Nationals won the Virginia League championship and pennant in their last season at a Washington Senators affiliate, remaining the only team in the league with an affiliation. With a record of 71\u201357, Emporia ended the regular season in first place, finishing 3.0 games ahead of the second place Petersburg Generals. Playing under manager Morrie Aderholt, the Nationals won both playoff series to claim the championship. In the 1st round of the playoffs, Emporia defeated the Hopewell Blue Sox in five games to advance. In the Finals, the Nationals won the championship in defeating Petersburg 4 games to 2. Emporia's LeRoy Dietzel scored 121 runs to led the league and teammate John Garrison's 170 hits led the league.\n\nFollowing the 1950 championship, Washington saw an imbalance in affiliate teams within the Virginia League. Ossie Bluege and the Washington Senators ended the affiliation with Emporia. In 1951, Washington transferred their Class D level affiliation to the Roanoke Rapids Jays of the Coastal Plain League.\n\nIn their final season, the renamed Emporia \"Rebels\" missed the playoffs with a last place finish in the Virginia League standings. Playing under managers Joe Mills and Harry Martin, the Rebels ended the Virginia League regular season in sixth place with a record of 39\u201378, finishing 40.0 games behind the first place Colonial Heights-Petersburg Generals.\n\nThe Virginia League permanently folded as a minor league following the 1951 season.

In 1950, it changed its name to the Union of Land and Forests, to better reflect its membership.\n\nThe scope of the union gradually increased.  In 1960, employees of food purchasing businesses were transferred from the Union of Trade, Food and Enjoyment, followed in 1964 by workers in feed mixing plants, and in 1968 by all remaining workers in food manufacturing and processing.

{"eng_Latn":"Anarchism in Peru emerged from the Peruvian trade union movement during the late 19th century and the first two decades of the 20th century.\n\nHistory \nThe beginnings of anarchism in Peru can be traced back to 1870. In the craftsmen's guilds at the end of the 19th century, a certain anarchist orientation began to gain influence. In 1904 the first anarchist organizations began to appear, with forming the \"Star of Per\u00fa\" Federation of Bakers (FOPEP), founded by the libertarian militants Fidel Garc\u00eda Gacit\u00faa, Urmachea and Manuel Caracciolo L\u00e9vano; that year they carried out their first strike. On May 1, 1905, a commemorative event for the Haymarket Martyrs was held for the first time. In 1907, Anarchists participated in strikes at the port of Callao, the repression that followed took the life of Florencio Aliaga. In 1906 the newspaper Humanity appeared in Lima, and in 1910 it published Free Pages by the Francisco Ferrer Rationalist Center. In 1907, the brothers L\u00e9vano, Romilio Quesada, Luis Felipe Grillo and the publishing group of \"Humanity\" founded the \"Primero de Mayo\" Center for Social Studies. The anarchist Julio Reynaga (1841\u20131923), one of the organizers of the Trujillo sugar workers. In this city, an anarchist group was formed by some Italian immigrants like Inocencio Lombardozzi. Reynaga was editor of \"El Jornalero\", whose offices were located in the premises of the \"Uni\u00f3n y Energ\u00eda\" Center for Social Studies. During these years, the main libertarian newspapers, in addition to those mentioned, were  El Ariete  (Arequipa),  La Abeja  (Chiclayo), La Antorcha and El Rebelde (Trujillo), El Hambriento and Simiente Roja, and Los Parias (Lima), directed by Gonz\u00e1lez Prada between 1904 and 1906.\n\nIn 1911, the first general strike in the textile industry was launched by anarchists. Then, in 1912, the Peruvian Regional Workers' Federation (FORP) arose from the anarcho-syndicalist movement. In 1913 the anarchists participated in the general strike called by the Union of Day Laborers, with the aim of achieving the 8-hour workday. Among the participating groups were the Peruvian Regional Workers Federation and its affiliated guilds and resistance societies, \"Luchadores por la Verdad\" (led by the bricklayer Abraham Guerrero), \"Luz y Amor\" (Callao) and the publishing group of the newspaper \"La Protesta\", the main anarchist newspaper in Peru (founded by A. Guerrero in 1911, edited until 1926). The 8-hour day was granted by the Jos\u00e9 Pardo y Barreda government in January 1919. Months later, the \"Pro-cheapening of Subsistence Committee\" was created, led by the joiner Nicol\u00e1s Gutarra, the purpose of which was to lower the prices of food, clothing, transportation, rent, and taxes. After the Legu\u00eda coup and the liberation of labor leaders from prison, in July 1919 the Peruvian Regional Workers' Federation was re-constituted with a declaration of anarcho-syndicalist principles. This stage of Peruvian anarchism was strongly influenced by the experiences of the Argentine Regional Workers' Federation (FORA), and of Italian and Spanish libertarian immigrants.\n\nIn those years, some libertarian workers met regularly at the L\u00e9vano house (located in La Victoria District, Lima) where they \"spoke like doctors. Backing up their opinions, they displayed their knowledge as they quoted Peter Kropotkin, Mikhail Bakunin, Anselmo Lorenzo and Errico Malatesta\". There were also some students who were sympathetic to libertarian ideas, such as Juan Manuel Carre\u00f1o and Erasmo Roca.\n\nAmong the prominent militants of the time were Manuel C. L\u00e9vano, Delf\u00edn L\u00e9vano, Carlos Barba, Nicol\u00e1s Gutarra, Pedro Cisneros, Adalberto Fonk\u00e9n, Eulogio Otaz\u00fa, Christian Dam, and Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Prada. Gonz\u00e1lez Prada was the author of important and influential texts:  Free Pages  (1894) and  Hours of Struggle  (1908). \n\nIn the 1910s and 1920s, in the town of Vitarte (east of Lima), there was a solid anarchist nucleus, linked to the workers at the local textile factory. One of the first propagandists of anarchist ideas and a member of the La Protesta group was the spinner called Juan H\u00edjar Salazar. Other anarchists from Vitarte included Celso Soto, Gumercindo Calder\u00f3n, Antonio Patr\u00f3n, No\u00e9 Salcedo, Fernando Borjas, Esther del Solar, Miguel Pasquel, Augustina Aran\u00edbar and A. Fonk\u00e9n. Julio Portocarrero, a prominent socialist trade unionist, was prone to libertarian ideas in his early youth, as he distributed the newspaper \"La Protesta\" for several years at the Vitarte factory. An important cultural tradition, promoted by libertarians in Vitarte, was the so-called Plant Festival, which emerged in the early 1920s, with the aim of becoming a proletarian alternative to the Christian holiday of Christmas. The first Feast of the Plant was held on December 25, 1921. The Libertarian Women's Center was one of the organizations that participated, along with several delegations.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the Union of Civil Construction Workers emerged, publishing El Nivel and El Obrero Constructor. During these years, government repression was felt strongly, closing printing presses and stores, in addition to murdering many anarchists. In Trujillo, anarcho-syndicalists participated in a workers' uprising, which would be capitalized on by the American Revolutionary Popular Alliance (APRA). The decline of anarchism due to repression caused anarchists to lose positions in the labor movement. Some activists were deported, in the case of Gutarra, who was deported to Colombia in the early 1920s, and then on to Panama in 1924.\n\nIn the Anarchist Federation of Peru was formed by some of the militants who continued the libertarian tradition gathered. They republished \"La Protesta\" for 2 years and edited documents until the 1960s, when it disappeared entirely. Teobaldo Cayetano was a baker worker who belonged to the \"Arm and brain\", a libertarian cell of the \"Star of Peru\" . He wrote in La Protesta, during the 1940s. In 1957, he was appointed defense secretary of the \"La Estrella\" Huancayo Society of Bakers. In the early 1960s, he was elected regional secretary of Lima by this union.\n\nThe Institute of Studies and Research of Cooperatives and Communities (Indeicoc) was a center of libertarian inspiration, which came into operation in the first half of the 70s. It claimed self-management and libertarian socialism as pillars of a free society: \u201cSelf-management or democratic management of the means of production, where the worker acquires a double condition: producer and manager of the company. He ceases to be a salaried worker and becomes a free and associated producer.\" Members of Indeicoc included Jaime Llosa Larrabure, V\u00edctor Guti\u00e9rrez Saco and Gerardo C\u00e1rdenas.\n\nLibertarian activity reappeared with some notoriety towards the end of the 1980s linked to the underground music movement of Lima, which acquired a gradual politicization and radicalization of its positions. The repressive climate generated by antiterrorist laws limited the growth and evolution of these anarchist groups, which were striving to differentiate themselves from the guerrilla left. In the early 1990s, anarchist groups less linked to the underground music scene began to appear. In Lima the anarcho-syndicalist groups \"Proletarian Autonomy\" and \"Collectivization\" emerged.\n\nIn 2001, after many years, an anarchist newspaper \"Disobedience\" began to be printed in Lima, which continues to appear to this day, maintaining a perspective of critical anarchism. The Libertarian Workshop was formed, which brought together activists from different generations, including V\u00edctor Guti\u00e9rrez, Ch. Z\u00e9nder and L. Villavicencio. In 2008, the bimonthly newspaper Humanity was founded by five libertarian activists. It took a combative and analytical style, within the guidelines of classical anarchism. Members of Humanity later founded the newspaper Direct Action, with an anarcho-communist tendency.\n\nWithin the especifist and platformist current is the Libertarian Socialist Union, a continuation of the Qhispikay Llaqta and Estrella Negra groups. Within the autonomist current is the \"Anarchist Group La Protesta\", the \"Arteria Libertaria Collective\", the \"Yacta Runa Autonomous Collective\" and the \"Active Minority Collective\" from Arequipa. Within the anarchopunk and counterculture spectrum there is the Anarkopunk Social Center, Anarchopunk Resistance, Anarchopunk Youth Collective of Tacna in Struggle, the band Asteroids 500. mg, Axi\u00f3n Anarkopunk and the bands Generaci\u00f3n Perdida, Autonom\u00eda, Feria Libertaria Kallejera and Men and Women in Our Anarchist Struggle.\n\nSee also \nCommunism in Peru\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n The protest and andeanization of anarchism in Peru, 1912\u20131915, by Gerardo Leibner (University of Tel Aviv)\n The anarchist workers' movement in Peru (1890\u20131930), by Jo\u00ebl Delhom (University of Bretagne-Sud)\n Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Prada, convicted and confessed anarchist, by Franz Garc\u00eda Uceda\n\nAnarchism in Peru\nHistory of Peru\nPeru\nAnarchism"}

{"eng_Latn":"\"The Floor\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Johnny Gill from his fourth studio album, Provocative (1993). The track, a dance and funk song, was written and produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and was released as the lead single from Provocative on May 4, 1993, through the Motown label. American band Mint Condition performs the \"floor\" chants on the song, with member Stokley providing additional background vocals.\n\nUpon its release, \"The Floor\" peaked at number 56 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and became a top-40 hit in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, it was certified gold for shipping over 35,000 copies. The song's music video, directed by English video director Julien Temple, features Gill and his backup dancers on a smoky dance floor built like a trampoline.\n\nChart performance\n\"The Floor\" debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 on May 22, 1993, as that week's \"Hot Shot Debut\". Four weeks later, on June 19, the song peaked at number 56, becoming Johnny Gill's second-lowest-charting solo single in the US, after \"Wrap My Body Tight\". It spent 10 weeks on the Hot 100 before leaving the chart. It became a top-20 hit on the Billboard Hot R&B Singles chart, reaching number 11, and also appeared on two other Billboard rankings: the Rhythmic chart (number 32) and the Dance Singles Sales chart (number 49). On the Canadian RPM Dance chart, the song peaked at number eight for two weeks.\n\nOutside North America, \"The Floor\" charted in Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. It spent a single week on the UK Singles Chart at number 53 and reached number 45 in the Netherlands, where it charted for three weeks. In New Zealand, the song debuted at number 34 on July 18, 1993, and peaked at number 29 during its fourth of five weeks on the RIANZ Singles Chart. It charted the highest in Australia, where it logged 23 weeks on the ARIA Singles Chart, reaching number six on October 10, 1993. It was Australia's 29th-most-successful single of 1993 and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipping over 35,000 copies.\n\nMusic video\nJulien Temple directed the music video for \"The Floor\" and filmed it in May 1993. It was choreographed by Michael Brown and Taco. The video features Gill and many backup dancers dancing on a foggy, multitiered dance floor with a built-in trampoline. According to Temple, he wanted the video to go along with the songs lyrics by \"exploring the floor\". Gill, who was 27 at the time of filming, was not in prime condition to perform the acrobatic moves in the video and spent most of his time with a masseuse who tended to his injuries.\n\nTrack listings\n\nUS cassette single and Japanese mini-CD single\n \"The Floor\" (LP version)\n \"Tell Me How You Want It\" (snippet)\n \"Long Way from Home\" (snippet)\n \"I Got You\" (snippet)\n \"Quiet Time to Play\" (snippet)\n \"I Know Where I Stand\" (snippet)\n\nUK 7-inch and cassette single; Australian cassette single\n \"The Floor\" (pop edit 1)\n \"The Floor\" (LP version)\n\nUK CD and 12-inch single; Australian CD single\n \"The Floor\" (pop edit 1)\n \"The Floor\" (Flyte Tyme edit)\n \"The Floor\" (LP version)\n \"The Floor\" (R&B edit)\n \"The Floor\" (instrumental)\n\nPersonnel\nPersonnel are adapted from the US cassette single sleeve.\n James Harris III \u2013 writing, production\n Terry Lewis \u2013 writing, background vocals, production\n Johnny Gill \u2013 vocals, background vocals\n Stockley \u2013 background vocals\n Mint Condition \u2013 \"floor\" chants\n Jheryl Busby \u2013 executive production\n\nCharts\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nCertifications\n\nRelease history\n\nReferences\n\n1993 singles\n1993 songs\nAmerican dance songs\nFunk songs\nJohnny Gill songs\nMotown singles\nMusic videos directed by Julien Temple\nSong recordings produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis\nSongs written by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis"}

{"eng_Latn":"An inner tube is an inflatable torus that forms the interior of some pneumatic tires. The tube is inflated with a valve stem, and fits inside of the casing of the tire. The inflated inner tube provides structural support and suspension, while the outer tire provides grip and protects the more fragile tube.\n\nUse \nTubed tires are widely used in bicycles and are also used in many motorcycles and heavy road vehicles such as trucks and buses. They are now less common in other wheeled vehicles because of the benefits of having no tube, such as the ability to operate at low pressure and at high pressure (unlike a tube tire, which would pinch at low pressure and burst at high pressure), without going flat. Large inner rings also make effective flotation devices and are widely used in the leisure activity of tubing.\n\nMaterial\nThe tube is made out of a mix of natural and synthetic rubber. Natural rubber is less prone to punctures and is often more pliable, while synthetic rubber is cheaper. Often racing bikes will have a higher percentage of natural rubber than regular bikes.\n\nPerformance\nInner tubes will wear out over time. This thins the rubber, making it more likely to burst. According to Dunlop, inner tubes should be changed every 6 months. Inner tubes also tend to be slower than tubeless tires because of the friction between the casing and the inner tube. Tires that use tubes are on average lighter, as the tube can be made relatively thin.\n\nBead tires, either with an inner tube or tubeless, can not be ridden flat, as the tire may separate from the rim. On the other hand, on tubular tires the tubing is sown to the tire, and if punctured, the tire can still be ridden flat. Tubeless tires are reportedly more comfortable to use, if attached to the bicycle properly.\n\nSee also\n Tubeless tires\n\nReferences\n\nTires\nBicycle parts\nRubber products"}

{"eng_Latn":"Mixture fraction () is a quantity used in combustion studies that measures the mass fraction of one stream (usually the fuel stream) of a mixture formed by two feed streams, one the fuel stream and the other the oxidizer stream. Both the feed streams are allowed to have inert gases. The mixture fraction definition is usually normalized such that it approaches unity in the fuel stream and zero in the oxidizer stream. The mixture-fraction variable is commonly used as a replacement for the physical coordinate normal to the flame surface, in nonpremixed combustion.\n\nDefinition\n\nAssume a two-stream problem having one portion of the boundary the fuel stream with fuel mass fraction  and another portion of the boundary the oxidizer stream with oxidizer mass fraction . For example, if the oxidizer stream is air and the fuel stream contains only the fuel, then  and . In addition, assume there is no oxygen in the fuel stream and there is no fuel in the oxidizer stream. Let  be the mass of oxygen required to burn unit mass of fuel (for hydrogen gas,  and for  alkanes, ). Introduce the scaled mass fractions as  and . Then the mixture fraction is defined as\n\nwhere \n\nis the stoichiometry parameter, also known as the overall equivalence ratio.

The mixture fraction is a function of both the spatial coordinates  and the time , i.e., \n\nWithin the mixing domain, there are level surfaces where fuel and oxygen are found to be mixed in stoichiometric proportion. This surface is special in combustion because this is where a diffusion flame resides.

{"eng_Latn":"Breezy is the tenth studio album by American singer Chris Brown, released on June 24, 2022, as the follow-up to his 2019 album Indigo. The artists featured on the album are Lil Wayne, Anderson .Paak, Blxst, Lil Baby, H.E.R., EST Gee, Wizkid, Jack Harlow, Tory Lanez, Fivio Foreign, Ella Mai, Yung Bleu, Capella Grey, Lil Durk, Davido and Bryson Tiller. The album marks his first studio album not being a double-disc since his 2015 album Royalty.\n\nBreezy is an R&B album, also containing trap-driven and soul songs. Its lyrical content mostly mixes themes of romance and sex. The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200, making it his lowest charting album in that country since Graffiti (2009). Breezy was preceded by three singles; \"Iffy\", \"WE (Warm Embrace)\" and \"Call Me Every Day\". At the 65th Grammy Awards, the deluxe edition of Breezy was nominated for Best R&B Album.\n\nBackground and recording \nChris Brown started working on the album simultaneously with the release of his ninth studio album Indigo. The singer said in July 2021, while working on the album, that he wanted to make some \"really endearing music\" that \"talk to women's soul\". In February 2022, he stated on his Instagram account that the album would contain some pure R&B material. He later said that on some of the album's songs he wanted to depict \"a different type of love mixed with heartbreak\". The recording sessions for Breezy ended during the first days of June 2022. During the album's work, the singer stated that he recorded almost 250 songs. During an interview with Big Boy, one week before Breezys release, the singer said that the project is more targeted towards his female audience.\n\n Artwork \n[[File:Breezy hothead.jpg|thumb|Brown's haircut designed for Breezys artwork]]\nBreezy artwork was revealed on May 18, 2022. The cover art consists of a black and white picture of the back of Brown's head with the album's title shaved into his hair. The haircut was done by American artist and barber Rob the Original. According to the barber, the haircut of the album's cover was designed by Brown and himself, and was inspired by works of Italian artist and barber Nto Hair Mugen. Shawn Grant of The Source found the artwork to be \"minimal\" compared to those of Brown's latest projects.\n\nComposition\nBreezy is an R&B record, containing a trap-driven first half, that includes most of the album's features, and a second half channelled into a soul soundscape, where Brown executes most of the album's solo performances. The album, with its 23 tracks, marks a departure from the singer's previous double-disc projects Heartbreak on a Full Moon and Indigo.\n\nBreezy'''s opener is the hip hop track \"Till the Wheels Fall Off\", featuring Lil Durk and Capella Grey, that runs for 5 minutes and 14 seconds, having a chorus that Brown executes singing with a bass voice and \"intense\" harmonies. Lyrically, on the song the artists give a hopeful introspection over their emotional struggles caused by their personal life's harshest challenges. The second track \"Catch a Body\", featuring Fivio Foreign, mixes R&B and drill music, containing swaggering lyrics. The following track, \"Pitch Black\", is an R&B mid-tempo with sexual themes, with an intro performed by Anderson .Paak. On \"Possessive\" Yung Bleu, Lil Wayne and Brown explore themes of jealousy, breakup and lovesickness, through a tone that was described by Miracle Oyedeji of The Inquirer as a \"mixture of loving and nagging\". \"Need You Right Here\", \"Hmhmm\", and \"Addicted\" are trap-influenced R&B tracks with debaucherous themes. \"Survive the Night\" is an alternative R&B track about drug addiction, where the singer approaches drugs as a lover that keeps hurting him, but he can't get rid off her from his emotions. Oyedeji stated that the track is reminiscent of some material off Brown's 2017 album Heartbreak on a Full Moon.\n\nThe thirteenth track, the R&B and soul slow-jam \"Sleep at Night\", marks a change of tone on the album, into a slower \"soulful\" soundscape. The track was noted for showcasing the singer's timbre and falsetto. \"Passing Time\" is an \"80's inspired\" mid-tempo where the singer is conversing with his lover asking for reassurance. \"WE (Warm Embrace)\" is an R&B slow-jam, that contains an interpolation of Guy's 1991 single \"Let's Chill\". Keithan Samuels of Rated R&B commented its. lyrical content saying that it \"shows the tender side of Brown as he aims to sexually please his stressed-out partner the best way he can\". \"Dream\", \"Slide\" and \"Harder\" are pure R&B tracks, that mix romantic and sexual themes. The album's standard edition ends with \"Luckiest Man\", a song where Brown croons his confidence of wanting to spend the rest of his life with his loved one.\n\nCritical reception\n\nMiracle Oyedeji of The Inquirer stated that the album consists of \"24 solid songs\" with Brown doing \"amazingly well vocally and lyrically\". AllMusic editor Andy Kellman praised Breezys \"soulful\" side, stating that it \"contains some of the smoothest R&B he has made\", but was dissatisfied with its \"boastful\" hip hop-infused side. Lauren Floyd of HipHopDX expressed a mixed response, stating that on the album \"certain songs sway from trend to trend or the preferences of its features mask more than advertising Brown's individuality\".\n\nRelease and promotion\n\nOn November 4, 2019, Brown posted three videos that showed snippets from songs that he recently worked on, supposedly called \"Get Naked\", \"Hit My Line\" and \"Stressed\". On December 22, 2019, Brown announced that he was working on new material for his next album, posting an Instagram story where he wrote  \"2020, what do you think my 10th album is going to be called?\". A couple months following the release of his collaborative mixtape with Young Thug, Slime & B, on July 9, 2020, he announced that the name of his tenth album would be Breezy, making a reference to his stage nickname. On October 22, 2020 he shared through his social media a snippet of a song supposedly called \"On Some New Shit\", in a video that showed him working and recording the song in a hotel room in London, also suggesting the possibility of releasing the album in 2021 in the video's caption. In November, Brown created an OnlyFans account, where he posted snippets from the songs \"Sleep at Night\" and \"Warm Embarce\", during his travel in Tulum, Mexico. Two days before Christmas 2020, Brown posted on his Instagram account a picture that showed a pen and a piece of paper, captioning it with \"My heart on this pen and pad. A SIDE B SIDE. Hope y'all f**k with my frequency. No time soon\", hinting the possibility of Breezy being his third consecutive double-album, following Heartbreak on a Full Moon and Indigo. On January 8, 2021 Forbes published an article that listed Breezy among the most anticipated R&B albums of 2021. In June 2021 he said that he was not in a rush to release his new album, by posting an Instagram story where he wrote \"I ain't dropping my album until I'm ready. I need to give y'all a chance to miss me\".\n\nMonths later, on December 18, he announced the release of the lead single of Breezy for January 2022. On the first day of 2022 he announced the title of the single, \"Iffy\", through a teaser of its music video, announcing its release for January 14, while also revealing that Breezy would have the same amount of songs of his debut album, because he wanted to \"keep it classic\". In March he announced that the already previewed song \"Warm Embrace\" would be the second single, announcing its release date for April 1, and teasing a joint tour for Summer 2022 with a mystery co-headliner. Two days before the release of the single, he revealed that Breezy would be released during summer 2022. In late April he announced his \"One of Them Ones Tour\" with rapper Lil Baby as a co-headlining act. On May 9 he announced that the album would be released in June. Nine days later he revealed Breezy release date, June 24, along with its cover art, and a list of features including Lil Wayne, Blxst, H.E.R., Ella Mai, Jack Harlow, Tory Lanez, Fivio Foreign, Yung Bleu, EST Gee and Wizkid, hinting that more features could be on the album.\n\nBrown unveiled the album's track listing on June 7, while also posting a video of him dancing to a snippet of \"Possessive\". Two weeks before the album's release, Brown has debuted the track \"Wheels Fall Off\", performing the track for the first time for the \"4ShootersOnly\" music platform, in a video portraying himself alone with a microphone in his backyard, while he smokes a blunt and executes the song. That same day he posted a snippet of \"Call Me Every Day\", featuring Nigerian artist WizKid, on his Instagram account. On June 21, he released the music video for \"WE (Warm Embrace)\", starring Normani and directed by Arrad.Breezy was released on June 24, 2022, by RCA Records and CBE with a standard version having 23 tracks, and another version the song \"Iffy\" as a bonus track. On July 8, an expanded version of the album with nine new songs was released.\n\nCommercial performance\nIn the United States, Breezy debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 with 72,000 album-equivalent units, which included 5,000 pure album sales in its first week, making it his 11th top-ten album in the country. The album also accumulated 87.36 million on-demand audio streams in the United States for its track list of 24 songs. Five songs from Breezy charted on the Billboard Hot 100 during its debut week, making Chris Brown surpass Elvis Presley as the eighth artist with the most entries on the Hot 100, for a total of 112 entries on the chart. In its second week, the album remained in the top ten and fell to number eight, earning 35,000 album-equivalent units. The album spent three consecutive weeks in the top ten of the Billboard'' 200.\n\nTrack listingNotes \"Pitch Black\" features uncredited vocals by Anderson .PaakSample credits'\n \"Psychic\" contains a sample from \"Me & U\", written by Ryan Leslie, as performed by Cassie.\n \"WE (Warm Embrace)\" contains a portion of the composition \"Let's Chill\", written by Bernard Belle, Teddy Riley, Keith Sweat, as performed by Guy.\n \"Dream\" contains a sample from \"What They Want\", written by Joe Moses, Kaniel Castaneda, as performed by Joe Moses.\n \"Harder\" contains a portion of the composition \"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\", written by D'Angelo, Raphael Saadiq, as performed by D'Angelo\n \"Iffy\" contains a sample from \"Drag Rap\" by The Showboys and contains interpolations of \"In Da Club\", written by Curtis Jackson, Andre Young & Mike Elizondo, as performed by 50 Cent & \"Never Leave You (Uh Oooh, Uh Oooh)\", written by Lumidee Cede\u00f1o, Teddy Mendez, Edwin Perez, Steven Marsden, as performed by Lumidee.\n\nCharts\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nReferences\n\n2022 albums\nChris Brown albums\nRCA Records albums\nSoul albums by American artists\nAlbums produced by OG Parker\nAlbums produced by RoccStar\nTrap music albums\nAlbums produced by Blaisebeatz"}

{"eng_Latn":"The New Republic: Heir to the Empire Sourcebook is a supplement published by West End Games (WEG) in 1992 for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, itself based on the Star Wars franchise.\n\nContents\nHeir to the Empire Sourcebook provides gamemasters with resources to create campaigns  set in the days immediately following the fall of the Star Wars Empire depicted in the movie Return of the Jedi. The material in the book is based upon the novel Heir to the Empire by Timothy Zahn, the first book in Zahn's Thrawn trilogy. Information, background and game statistics are provided for all of the characters, alien races, droids and starships mentioned in Zahn's book.\n\nWith the fall of the Empire and establishment of the New Republic, player characters are no longer secret operatives, but can now openly operate as \"troubleshooters, representatives and soldiers.\"\n\nPublication history\nIn 1987, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Star Wars, Lucasfilm licensed WEG to produce a role-playing game based on the first three Star Wars movies. The result was Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game. From  1987\u20131991, WEG produced 23 supplementary sourcebooks, all based on the original three movies (now known as Episodes IV\u2013VI). In 1991, Lucasfilm hired Timothy Zahn to write novels set after the end of the first three movies, and Zahn subsequently produced Heir to the Empire (1991), the first book of the Thrawn Trilogy. WEG produced Heir to the Empire Sourcebook in 1992, a 144-page hardcover sourcebook (replaced in the second printing by a softcover version) designed by Bill Slavicsek, with interior art by Allen Nunis, Xeno Beck, and Paul Daly, and cover art by Tom Jung. Following its release, WEG published the second edition rules for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, making Heir to the Empire Sourcebook the last book published under the first edition rules.\n\nReception\nIn Issue 68 of Challenge, Steve Maggi lauded this book, commenting, \"There is finally solid information for a running a Star Wars campaign beyond the events in Return of the Jedi.\" He admired the production values of the hardcover version, especially the illustrations, calling them \"very helpful in establishing the look and mood of the era.\" However, Maggi was disappointed by the repetition of \"information already printed in previous works for the Star Wars RPG\", including information on starfighters and primary capital ships, as well as the plot and basics about the Star Wars universe.\" He was also disappointed that much of the text in the sourcebook was a paraphrase of the Timothy Zahn novel, and also noted the \"lack of adventure material. It would have been very helpful {...} if this book came with a sample adventure.\" He concluded with an ambivalent recommendation, saying, \"If you are a Star Wars fan {...] this book is a must [...} For gamers who only collect material that pertains to the game, I would not recommend this book.\"   \n\nIn the November 1993 edition of Dragon (Issue #199), Rick Swan liked the production values of the softcover version, calling it \"handsome\", and thought the opening chapter provided \"an excellent overview of the Republic.\" He called the chapters containing updates on all essential Star Wars characters and the new characters introduced in the Zahn novel \"an indispensable base for staging original adventures, even for players intimately familiar with the [Zahn] novel.\" However, Swan wished that the book had removed information on planets and aliens and instead \"used the pages for an adventure or campaign material [...] I would have preferred a collection of original scenarios or more tips on how to design them myself. It\u2019s a frustrating omission in an otherwise superb sourcebook.\" He concluded by giving this book an above average rating of 4 out of 5, saying, \"Heir to the Empire should be considered a core component of the New Republic line.\"\n\nOther reviews\nBackstab Issue 1 (January\u2013February 1997, p.50, in French)\n\nSee also\n Dark Force Rising Sourcebook, based on Zahn's second novel in the Thrawn Trilogy.\n The Last Command Sourcebook, based on Zahn's third novel in the Thrawn Trilogy.\n\nReferences\n\nRole-playing game supplements introduced in 1992\nStar Wars: The Roleplaying Game supplements\nThrawn"}

{"eng_Latn":"The Leopard 2PL is a main battle tank used by the Polish Armed Forces, and is a modernized version of the older Leopard 2A4 tank, phased out by Germany and first acquired by Poland in the 2000s. The modernisation is currently being carried out in cooperation with Rheinmetall and the Polish Armaments Group ().\n\nHistory \nAs soon as the Polish Land Forces took over the first Leopard 2A4 tanks from the Bundeswehr in 2002, it was recognized that their modernization was necessary, however, the first efforts to develop its plan and scope did not begin until mid-2012.\n\nThe program was called Leopard 2PL and as a result of the conducted works, two variants of modernization were defined. The basic one included the introduction of an electric turret drive and gun stabilization (in place of hydraulic one), installation of an auxiliary power unit (APU), modernization of the optoelectronic system through e.g. installation of new thermal imaging cameras, modernization of the driver's seat and a new anti-explosion, fire and mine protection package. The second variant was extended to also include a BMS combat management system, installation of a remote-controlled weapon stations on the turret of the tank, new types of ammunition, air conditioning systems in the driver and combat compartment, and modernization of the electronics cooling system.\n\nFinally, modernization program was included in the \"Technical Modernization Plan of the Polish Armed Forces for 2013-2022\" () in December 2012. In early March 2013, invitations were sent to interested parties for the technical dialogue, which took place from March to August. \n\nIn October 2013, a tender was announced to select a contractor for the program. Three consortia formed to bid: \n\n  from Pozna\u0144, Wojskowe Zak\u0142ady \u0141\u0105czno\u015bci Nr. 2 and Rheinmetall Landsysteme GmbH,\n PCO and ASELSAN Elektronik,\n Bumar-\u0141ab\u0119dy,  and .\n\nThe final offer was submitted by the third consortium and negotiations with the  had started. In December 2014, the consortium submitted the final proposal based on the solutions of their foreign partner Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, but in 2015 the procedure to select the contractor was terminated due to formal deficiencies and the low participation of Polish industry in the program. \n\nThat same year, the decision was made to contract the modernization to the Polish Armaments Group (owner of Bumar-\u0141ab\u0119dy and OBRUM). The final offer was made in November 2015, thus starting negotiations.\n\nOn December 28, 2015, an agreement was signed between the Inspectorate of Armaments () and a consortium consisting of PGZ and Bumar-\u0141ab\u0119dy for the modernization of 128 Leopard 2 tanks with an option for another 14 units. The German partner of the consortium was the German company Rheinmetall Landsysteme, which in the past co-produced Leopard 2 tanks. The contract amount was 2.415 billion PLN. On June 20, 2018, an annex was signed using the option to upgrade 14 tanks, i.e. all Leopard 2A4 tanks used by the Army. The cost of the contract increased to 2.721 billion PLN. The contract originally assumed that all copies of the base order would be transferred by 2020 and those from options for 14 machines by 2021.\n\nThe original work schedule assumed that the entire work process would be divided into five stages. In the first stage for 2016, preparation of all infrastructure and resources needed for modernization were anticipated. The second stage predicted that from November 2016 to the end of 2017, dismantling of the machines and preparation for the modernization process would be carried out, while in the third stage, falling in 2018, technology transfer and staff training on a trial batch of tanks. From June 2018 to March 2019, the process of starting production and delivery of the pre-series machine to the recipient was to begin, and the last fifth stage lasting from January 2019 to November 2020 was to begin serial modernization of machines and deliveries (only machines from the first contract, i.e. 128 pieces). However, the original modernization process envisaged that the prototype in the number of one piece would be delivered by the third quarter of 2018, the test batch in the number of 5 pieces (the process of training Polish specialists and technology transfer) made in Germany would be delivered by the end of 2018, the test batch comprising 12 machines already completed in Poland, it will be delivered by the end of the first quarter of 2019, and serial production of the other machines under the basic contract is to be carried out from the second quarter of 2019 to the third quarter of 2020.\n\nOn February 18, 2016, a detailed agreement was signed with a German partner, which specified the terms of cooperation between ZM Bumar-\u0141ab\u0119dy and Rheinmetall. The contract assumed that the German company would be responsible for: developing the tank modernization project, preparing the necessary technical documentation together with Polish partners, making a prototype of the 2PL version car and tanks of the trial batch (five of which includes the process of training Polish specialists and technology transfer to Poland), providing ZM Bumar-\u0141ab\u0119dy with the necessary technical support in starting production of serial wagons, providing necessary tools and transferring know-how technology. During the Eurosatory 2018 trade fair, representatives of Rheinmetall announced the completion of factory tests of the Leopard 2PL prototype tank. \n\nIn August 2018, the vehicle was sent to the Military Armored and Automotive Institute in Sulej\u00f3wek, where it underwent further national tests in Poland. In 2018, Reinmetall handed over to ZM Bumar-\u0141ab\u0119dy the first pre-series copies, which opened the way to the modernization of machines already in Poland, after the positive completion of testing the prototype vehicle. The prototype tests were prolonged, which influenced the modernization of further copies and their delivery to the recipient. During the prototype testing there were also problems with the chassis, the repair of which prolonged the testing process, which meant that serial production could not be started. \n\nThe prototype was completed on May 8, 2020. On May 28, 2020, the Polish Land Forces received the first copies from the pre-series party. The contract was extended until the end of July 2023.\n\nThe contract was annexed five times, this was mainly due to not taking into account the restoration of efficiency of some tank elements, which turned out to be necessary and the different state of wear of individual copies. The final cost of the program increased to 3.29 billion PLN.\n\nDescription \nLeopard 2PL is a third generation Main Battle Tank, made in cooperation with Polish Armaments Group and Rheinmetall Landsystems. The tank is designed to master and maintain the area, and support fire from deck weapons of mechanized and motorized subunits, in all weather conditions, both during the day and at night.\n\nAs a result of the work, two versions of the vehicles were developed: the Leopard 2PL version, which is currently supplied to the military, and the Leopard 2PLM1, which was created by decision in 2018. The German partner is responsible for the production of the prototype variant of the Leopard 2PLM1. The vehicle was delivered in January 2021, and its tests began in February 2021. \n\nThe differences in the field of tanks in the Leopard 2PL and Leopard 2PM1 versions are that the machines in the 2PLM1 version are equipped with an EGPT compartment warning system, a system protecting the network electronics against the start-up time, modification operating modes of the laser rangefinder, an additional socket for batteries and the PIX combination, allows the commander to automatically rotate the optoelectronic head of the PERI observation and aiming device to the \"six o'clock\" and \"twelve o'clock\" position relative to the tank's hull.\n\nArmor \nThe modernization of the Leopard 2A4 to the 2PL standard includes the strengthening of the ballistic resistance of the turret to a level exceeding that of the Leopard 2A5 version. Additional external armor modules are mounted around the vehicle turret. It was not decided to reinforce the hull and vehicle chassis due to the significant increase in vehicle weight and cost reduction. Special anti-splinter liners have been installed inside the vehicle to protect the crew inside the vehicle against splashes and armor fragments in the event of a puncture or hit.\n\nArmament \nThe main armament of the tank remained the Rheinmetall Rh-120 smoothbore gun in the L\/44 version, but it was modified to adapt to the use of new types of ammunition, i.e. DM63 armor-piercing shell and programmable DM11 ammunition. Left and right resistors, return, recoil indicator and container for shell bottom were replaced, in order to use DM11 ammunition, a programming system was introduced in the cannon's falling-block action, as well as a fire control system and electronic cannon trigger assembly. A new on-board computer was installed with new ballistic tables. MG-3 machine guns were not exchanged for another model. The two plane gun stabilizer system of the cannon and turret drives were changed from hydraulic to purely electric.\n\nOptics \nThe gunner's sight and sights of the gunner and the commander were modernized by adding Polish thermal imaging cameras of the third generation KLW-1 Asteria made by Polish PCO. Driver awareness was improved by installing a KDN-1 Nyks day \/ night reversing camera also PCO production. A monitor-control panel for the commander was installed, which enables: alternative image transmission from the modernized EMES 15 sight and PERI R17A3L4 CP instrument, performing a full test of tower systems in cooperation with the modernized RPP testing block and control of tower systems from the level of the commander, which allows operation in hunter-killer mode.\n\nCommunication \nA new, digital communication bus was used. The radio has not been replaced with a modern model.\n\nOther \nTank propulsion units were subjected to general repairs, an auxiliary power unit (APU) with a power of 17 kW was installed, in addition to the installation of anti-shrapnel liners, crew safety was improved by the use of an explosion-proof system with cylinders with Deugen-N extinguishing agent and the fire system was modernized by adding a new control panel and cylinders with extinguishing agent, additional transport baskets were mounted outside the turret and adaptation of the evacuation equipment to the tank combat weight increased to 60 tons.\n\nService in Polish Land Forces \nThe first Leopard 2PL tanks were delivered to military units in May 2020. First six vehicles were delivered to the Leopard Training Center () in \u015awi\u0119tosz\u00f3w from 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade () and other two tanks were delivered to 1st Warsaw Armoured Brigade () in Weso\u0142a. By the end of 2020, 12 Leopard 2PL tanks were delivered to the army. By the end of 2021 the 1st Armored Brigade is the first unit to have a full company in its structures (14 tanks). Previously, the unit had a tank company in the Leopard 2A4 version of the 1st Tank Battalion. By December 2021, 20 machines were delivered.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n Modernization of the Leopard 2A4 tanks to the Leopard 2PL version, Zak\u0142ady Mechaniczne Bumar-\u0141ab\u0119dy s.a.

{"eng_Latn":"The silver seatrout (Cynoscion nothus), also known as white trout, sugar trout, and silver weakfish, is a species of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Sciaenidae, the drums and croakers. This fish is found in the Western Atlantic Ocean.\n\nDistribution\nThe species is found in the western Atlantic, across the eastern areas of coastal North America and in the Bahamas. It occurs in marine and brackish areas normally at depths of 2\u201318 m, reaching 30 m on occasion. The fish looks like a weakfish or speckled trout without specks or spots across the back. This fish is often easily confused with the sand seatrout. One of the main habitat differences between the two is that this species is more often found in relatively deeper water.\n\nDescription\nSilver seatrout are largely silver with a dusky gray back and a white belly. Like many weakfish species, they have vampire-like fangs on their upper jaw, well as smaller teeth throughout the entire mouth. Their mouths are also often a bright yellow. Their fins are tinged yellow, except for the upper dorsal fin, which matches the gray color of the back. Adults have an average length of 14\u201317\u00a0cm, and uncommonly up to 36\u00a0cm. Individuals generally have a maximum lifespan of two years. Individuals over 36\u00a0cm have been occasionally recorded, such as the case in Texas where the state record for a silver seatrout is .\n\nDiet\nSilver seatrout diets consist of crustaceans and small fish.\n\nFisheries\nSilver seatrout are caught mostly in bottom trawls, partucularly as bycatch in shrimp fisheries, and with pound nets. No separate statistics are reported for silver seatrout landed and this species is likely to be confused for Cynoscion regalis in landings along the eastern coast of the United States and for C. arenarius in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nReferences\n\nSilver seatrout\nFish described in 1848\nTaxa named by John Edwards Holbrook"}
{"eng_Latn":"Triller is an American video-sharing social networking service. The service allows users to create and share short-form videos, including videos set to, or automatically synchronized to music using artificial intelligence technology. Triller was released for iOS and Android in 2015, and initially operated as a video editing app before adding social networking features.\n\nIn mid-2020, the app gained prominence in India and the United States as a competitor to the similar Chinese-owned app TikTok, after the service was banned in India, and faced the threat of a ban in the U.S. Triller later expanded into sports promotion, distributing pay-per-view boxing events between Mike Tyson and Roy Jones Jr. and Jake Paul and Ben Askren, both incorporating appearances by internet, sports, music, and entertainment personalities.\n\nHistory\nTriller was launched in 2015 by co-founders David Leiberman and Sammy Rubin. The app was originally positioned as a video editor, using artificial intelligence to automatically edit distinct clips into music videos. They later launched Triller Famous, a page within the app that featured curated selections of user videos. In 2016, the app was purchased by Carnegie Technologies and converted into a social networking service by allowing users to follow each other and share their videos publicly. In 2019, Ryan Kavanaugh's Proxima Media made a majority investment. It is headquartered in Los Angeles, California, and is currently led by CEO Mahi de Silva.\n\nOn June 29, 2020, Government of India banned TikTok, among other apps stating that they were \"prejudicial to [the] sovereignty and integrity\" of India. Triller, which had planned to enter into the Indian market by the end of 2020, saw a spike from less than 1 million users to over 30 million users in the country overnight.  In July 2020, Triller sued ByteDance,  the Chinese parent company of TikTok, for infringing patents relating to video editing.\n\nIn August 2020, U.S. president Donald Trump signed an executive order which threatened to ban TikTok from operating within the United States, citing threats to national security, unless it was sold by ByteDance. The Trump administration stated that TikTok had until November 12, 2020, to assure the administration that the app did not pose any national security threats to the U.S. Following this order and news of possible purchases of TikTok's American operations by companies such as Oracle, Triller jumped from number 198 to number one in the App Store in the U.S., while TikTok dropped down to number three. The discussions surrounding TikTok's potential ban in the United States caused popular TikTok stars, including Charli D\u2019Amelio and her family, to join Triller. Trump joined Triller himself and posted his first video on August 15, 2020. The video received over a million views within hours.\n\nIn August 2020, Triller partnered with B2B music company 7digital, which will provide Triller with access to its catalogue of 80 million tracks and automatically report usage data to Sony Music, Warner Music Group, Universal Music Group and Merlin Network. On October 2, 2020, Triller signed licensing deals with the rights societies PRS for Music, GEMA, STIM and IMRO, and the publishers Concord, Downtown and Peermusic.\n\nOn February 5, 2021, Universal Music Group removed its catalogue from Triller, citing unpaid music royalties. On March 24, 2021, Triller signed a licensing agreement with the National Music Publishers' Association.\n\nFeatures\nThe Triller app allows users to create music videos, skits, and lip-sync videos containing background music. The app's spotlight feature is its special auto-editing tool, which uses artificial intelligence to automatically stitch separate video clips together without the user having to do it themselves. The separate video clips are created to the same background music, but users are able to shoot multiple takes with different filters or edits each time. Once the auto-editing tool stitches the individual clips together, users can rearrange and replace clips as desired. Users can also customize videos by applying filters and text.\n\nWhen creating a video, users can choose to make a \"music video\" or a \"social video\". A \"music video\" allows users to add music and trim the audio to personal preference. Unlike the music video option, a \"social video\" does not require the user to add music in the background. The app's auto-editing tool is only used when making music videos, as it uses the background track to help arrange and synchronize the clips. Users can also link their accounts with Apple Music or Spotify to integrate their playlists.\n\nIncomplete videos that are yet to be shared appear in a user's \"Projects\" folder. Once finalized, a video can be shared with other users of the app or through social media platforms such as  Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, and YouTube. Any video on Triller can also be downloaded or shared through links, text messages, or direct messaging to other users within the app.\n\nThe app is divided into three video feeds, consisting of videos from creators that the user follows, the \"Social\" feed (which showcases trending videos and those by verified users), and the \"Music\" feed (which exclusively features music videos).\n\nTriller accounts can be made either public or private. When the account is public, any user can view the videos on that account. When the account is private, only approved users can view the videos on that account. Users with private accounts can change the privacy settings of individual videos on their accounts from private to public, making the selected videos viewable to anyone on the app. In accordance with online child privacy laws in the United States, children under the age of 13 must receive parental consent in order to create an account on Triller.\n\nUser characteristics and behavior \nIn August 2020, Triller reported that it had been downloaded over 250 million times worldwide. Mobile analytics firm Apptopia disputed the numbers and claimed they were inflated, suggesting that the app had only been downloaded 52 million times since it first launched in 2015. Apptopia pulled the report after Triller threatened to sue the company.\n\nThe app has been downloaded 23.8 million times in the U.S., with users spending an average of more than 20 minutes per day. A large number of downloads come from India, where TikTok has been banned, as well as from various European and African countries.\n\nIn October 2020, Triller CEO Mike Lu stated that the app has 100 million monthly active users (MAU). In February 2021, Billboard reported that Triller had \"reported higher numbers of monthly active users to the public than it reports to [music] rights holders.\" CEO Lu argued that \"there is no legal definition\" of monthly and daily active users, and that \"if someone is trying to compare TikTok's MAU\/DAU to ours\u2014which means they are saying we have the same definition of MAU\/DAU\u2014there is an inherent misunderstanding about Triller's business and business model. It\u2019s like trying to compare a fish and a bicycle.\" In a public statement, Lu denied that the company had inflated its user metrics.\n\nTriller has attracted celebrity users like Chance the Rapper, LIl Tecca, Lil Mosey, Justin Bieber, Marshmello, The Weeknd, Alicia Keys, Cardi B, Eminem, Post Malone and Kevin Hart. The app is also used by TikTok stars such as Charli D\u2019Amelio, Josh Richards, Noah Beck, Griffin Johnson, and Dixie D\u2019Amelio. Triller has offered large sums of money, company equity, and advisory roles to encourage prominent TikTok users to move to Triller, such as The Sway Boys. Sway House member Josh Richards became the Chief Strategy Officer of Triller after concerns regarding user data motivated him to find a \"safe place\" for himself and his followers.\n\nEvents\nIn April 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Triller organized a three-day streaming music festival known as \"Trillerfest\" in support of No Kid Hungry and the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund. The event was headlined by Don Diablo, Marshmello, Migos, Pitbull, Snoop Dogg, and Wyclef Jean.\n\nBoxing\nIn July 2020, Triller announced that it had partnered with Mike Tyson's Legends Only League to become the media partner for its boxing events, with its inaugural event being an exhibition fight between Tyson and Roy Jones Jr. on November 28, 2020, distributed via pay-per-view. Triller would handle distribution of the fight to pay-per-view platforms and services such as Fite TV, and also carry a documentary miniseries leading into the fight. The PPV would not be carried within the Triller app itself due to its focus on short-form video, and a goal for wider distribution via traditional PPV outlets. Following the event, it was reported that the PPV had at least 1.6 million buys, surpassing UFC 251 as the most-bought combat sports PPV of 2020.\n\nRyan Kavanaugh, CEO of parent company Proxima Media, described the fight as being the launch of Triller's \"high-end live events business\", and explained that they aimed to reach audiences beyond core boxing fans by leveraging the present \"cultural zeitgeist\"; the PPV included a co-main event between internet celebrity and boxer Jake Paul and former NBA player Nate Robinson, music performances by acts such as Wiz Khalifa, and featured Snoop Dogg as a commentator. Kavanaugh later referred to this practice as a \"four-quadrant\" entertainment event, supplementing boxing with internet, music, and sports personalities.\n\nIn December 2020, Triller announced a partnership with Snoop Dogg to form Triller Fight Club\u2014a \"boxing league\" that would be produced and hosted by Snoop Dogg, and consist of a series of annual PPV cards with  \"four-quadrant\" elements carried over from the Tyson\/Jones event. The first event under the banner was held on April 17, 2021, with a main event between Jake Paul and Ben Askren, and performances by The Black Keys, Diplo, Doja Cat, Justin Bieber, Major Lazer, Saweetie, and Mt. Westmore \u2014a supergroup featuring Snoop, Ice Cube, Too Short and E-40. The event was held behind closed doors at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, with Triller intentionally limiting attendance to 100 spectators chosen via promotional contests on the Triller app; Kavanaugh described this as a \"golden ticket\" model supporting its goal to give home viewers a \"front row\" experience.\n\nIn February 2021, it was reported that Triller Fight Club had won a purse bid to promote the fight between Te\u00f3fimo L\u00f3pez and George Kambosos to defend L\u00f3pez's unified lightweight titles, beating out Matchroom and Top Rank with a bid reported to be $6 million. Kavanaugh stated that the match would likely be a co-main event on a future card. In March 2021, Oscar De La Hoya announced a comeback fight during a planned card on July 3. In May 2021, Triller signed long-time HBO boxing personality Jim Lampley as its lead commentator; his role was expected to begin with Te\u00f3fimo L\u00f3pez vs. George Kambosos Jr. on June 19. However, after the L\u00f3pez vs. Kambosos fight was postponed on multiple occasions, the International Boxing Federation ruled that Triller was in breach of their contractual obligation to stage the fight, subsequently awarding the rights to Matchroom as the second highest bidders.\n\nBasketball\nIn June 2021, Triller partnered with Big3 to serve as a digital media partner for the league. This will include 30 hours of live games streaming within the Triller app (including exclusive coverage of the Big3 All-Star Game), coverage of the Big3 draft, social media presences, and courtside advertising.\n\nControversies\nIn September 2020, Triller claimed to serve 100 million active monthly users, but this number was quickly disputed by six former employees interviewed by Business Insider. Within a few weeks of Triller's claim, employees shared screenshots of the company's internal analytics that showed less than 2.5 million active monthly users. The number of Triller's app installations came under scrutiny around the same time. Third-party analytics firm Apptopia estimated only 52 million lifetime installations of the app by August 2020 while Triller claimed 250 million. Triller threatened to sue Apptopia for publishing the report.\n\nIn February 2021, Universal Music Group (UMG) pulled all of its music from Triller's app because Triller \"shamefully withheld payments owed to our artists\" and refused to negotiate future music licensing. Triller responded with the assertion that \"relevant artists\" were already partnered with Triller, so a deal with UMG was unnecessary. The two companies reached an expanded licensing agreement in May 2021.\n\nIn November 2021, Triller owner Ryan Kavanaugh publicized Triller Fight Club's new Triller Triad Combat with an open invitation to UFC president Dana White. The invitation, wreathed in a floral border, personally invited White to the event and offered an arranged tour and personalized autograph. Kavanaugh's targeted appeal to Dana White may have been connected with White's comments on Triller in May 2021 when he dismissed questions about Triller saying, \"You think I care what Triller thinks? I don't even take their calls. This idiot calls me every day. He calls me every day: 'Please answer my call. Please talk to me. Why won't you talk to me?' Because I don't give a f*ck about you.\"\n\nLawsuits\nIn response to Triller's July 2020 patent suit against TikTok, TikTok and its parent company ByteDance filed a lawsuit against Triller, alleging the litigation initiated by Triller has \"cast a cloud\" over TikTok's reputation and business dealings.\n\nTriller has filed lawsuits against several websites and a 19-year-old alleging illegal distribution of its streamed April 2021 boxing event, seeking $100 million and $150,000 respectively in damages. Following the dismissal of the $100 million suit as a misjoinder, Triller's subsidiary Triller Fight Club filed an amended complaint against the H3 Podcast, a video podcast native to YouTube, seeking $50 million in damages. The podcast's host Ethan Klein claims his inclusion of a 45-second clip of the event in one of his broadcasts constitutes fair use and alleges that Ryan Kavanaugh, a major stakeholder, has instigated the lawsuit \"out of spite\".\n\nIn November 2021, Triller was sued for infringing a design patent and registered copyright and trademark in the marketing of Triller Fight Club's Triad Combat.\n\nOn 16 August 2022, Swizz Beatz and Timbaland sued Triller, alleging that they are owed over $28 million related to the purchase of the webcast series Verzuz. Triller had bought Verzuz in January 2021 for an undisclosed sum.\n\nSee also \nList of social networking services\nTimeline of social media\nChingari\nLikee\nHuddles\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official site  (in English)\n\n2015 software\nInternet culture\nInternet properties established in 2015\nIOS software\nMobile applications\nMobile social software\nMusic software\nSocial networking services\nVideo hosting\nVideo software"}

She has been referred to as the first female physician in Germany.\n\nStreicher was prohibited from studying medicine at the University because she was a woman. However, she studied medicine privately, likely from her brother Hans Augustin, who was a medical doctor. She was acknowledged to have sufficient knowledge to practice medicine in her hometown of Ulm and on 15 March 1561, Streicher was allowed to take the Hippocratic Oath, which had been binding since 1533. In this way she was appointed as a \"non-academic doctor in Ulm and was allowed to do medicine in private practice.\"\n\nHer reputation spread far and wide and many personalities came to Ulm for treatment, such as the Princess of Hohenzollern and the Bishop of Speyer. She was particularly known for her remedy for bladder stones that she produced herself. In 1576, she was even called to Regensburg to the bedside of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor who suffered from severe gout. Although she could not cure the emperor, she prescribed four medications to alleviate his suffering and remained with him until his death.\n\nStreicher was a successful businesswoman and contributed to the reputation of the city of Ulm.

{"eng_Latn":"James Ellis Barker (9 May 1870 \u2013 16 July 1948) was a British historian, journalist, homeopath and naturopath. Barker was also an alternative cancer treatment advocate who promoted the idea that cancer is caused by autointoxication from chronic poisoning and vitamin starvation.\n\nBiography\n\nBarker was born in Cologne as Otto Julius Eltzbacher and was naturalised as a British citizen in 1900. Barker wrote on politics warning Britain about the danger of conflict with the Kaiser's Germany and advocated free trade. He attempted to conceal his German Jewish origins. Barker was taught homeopathy by John Henry Clarke an anti-Semite. Barker became an influential British homeopath and took over the editorship of The Homeopathic World from Clarke in 1932. He renamed the magazine Heal Thyself which he co-edited with his wife, Eileen Homer. He was Honorary Secretary of the New Health Society.\n\nCancer research\n\nAt age thirty, Barker suffered from constipation. He believed he was in a state similar to that of a man about to develop cancer so he began to study food, improve his diet and exercise. He eliminated his constipation and came to the conclusion that he had prevented the occurrence of cancer in himself, so his system of dieting and exercise would prevent cancer in others. He argued that cancer was caused by autointoxication from chronic poisoning and vitamin starvation. Barker was influenced by the research of Sir William Arbuthnot Lane.\n\nBarker commented that cancer stemmed from \"autointoxication of the bowel. Apparently civilization and constipation go hand in hand.\" He stated that constipation is caused by the overuse of food preservatives, stress and the lack of \"natural foods\" in the diet. Barker opposed the use of toilet seats and promoted squatting which would assist bowel movements.\n\nIn 1924, Barker authored the book Cancer: How It Is Caused; How It Can Be Prevented, which ran to more than 400 pages. Barker stated that cancer is a disease of civilization and rarely occurs amongst primitive tribes or uncivilised nations due to their lack of intestinal stasis. He argued that cancer is caused by \"chronic poisoning\" from the bowels. Barker recommended a high-fibre diet of raw fruit, salads and wholemeal bread, cheese and eggs, with plenty of exercise. He campaigned for the consumption of raw vegetables and undried meats. In his book, Barker did not oppose the consumption of alcohol, coffee, tea or tobacco. However, in other publications he advised against coffee and tea as heat \"acts as a cancer poison\".\n\nThe book was negatively reviewed in medical journals for not providing reliable evidence for its claims. A review in the Journal of Cancer Research suggested that the \"publication of such a book does a great deal of harm because it misleads those who have no real knowledge and encourages charlatanry, of which there is already too much.\" A review in the Nature journal commented that \"In our opinion the book will do much more harm than good, as it can only have a deleterious action and make people concern themselves with morbid symptoms in their abdomens.\" A review in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that the book is a \"pernicious and harmful piece of literature\". George Soper suggested that the book is overloaded with long quotations from Sir William Arbuthnot Lane and concluded that Barker \"cannot be said to have advanced the subject of cancer control in any way\".\n\nSelected publications\n\nBritish Socialism: An Examination of its Doctrines, Policy, Aims and Practical Proposals (1908)\n101 Points Against Free Trade (1909)\nGreat and Greater Britain (1910)\nEconomic Statesmanship (1918)\nModern Germany: Its Rise, Growth, Downfall, and Future (1919)\nCancer: How It Is Caused; How It Can Be Prevented (With an Introduction by Sir William Arbuthnot Lane, 1924)\nAmerica's Secret: The Causes of Her Economic Success (1927)\nGood Health and Happiness (1927)\nMiracles of Healing and How They are Done: A New Path to Health (1931)\nCancer: The Surgeon and the Researcher (With an Introduction by Sir William Arbuthnot Lane, 1932)\nMy Testament of Healing (1939)\nNew Lives for Old: How to Cure the Incurable (With an Introduction by Sir Herbert Barker, 1949)\n\nQuotes\n\nSee also\n\nHastings Gilford\nErnest H.

{"eng_Latn":"The Steffen Boarding Method, also known as the Steffen Perfect or simply the Steffen Method is a proposed \"perfect aeroplane boarding method\" that would enable optimally fast and convenient way of sequencing passengers. The method was first introduced by astrophysicist Jason Steffen in 2008.\n\nThe method attempts to eliminate the buffers that slow down plane boarding, while simultaneously optimising speed and efficiency. The method has been criticised for its lack of human headway, as it would separate those boarding in groups, require a perfectly organised line, as well as uniform stowing and seating time. Steffen initially published his theory in 2008 in the Journal of Air Transport Management, and showed that his method was twice as fast as the standard back-to-front method, and 20-30% faster than random boarding groups.\n\nIn 2014, Steffen told Wired that despite the popularity of the method among passengers since the paper's publication, no airline had adopted the method as of yet.\n\nOrigin \nMost airlines tend to board passengers in a somewhat hierarchical system, loading passengers into planes back-to-front, but giving priority to those who have more tenure with that airline. However, the rest of the passengers, who have to board back-to-front, are aware of the inefficiency which is why some passengers attempt to pile on before the call of their gate. Another factor that slows down this boarding method is stowing. Steffen observed this, as well as the MythBusters episode, in which the presenters experiment with 173 plane boarders.\n\nIn an attempt to rectify this, Jason Steffen observed simulations and experiments to calculate the mathematically quickest way to board a plane. Steffen used his method on a 72-seat plane in a controlled experiment, finding his results to be faster than the average method.\n\nSpeed of boarding methods in minutes (Results of Steffen's experiment, 2011)\n\nMethod \nThe method files people into a plane in a straight line, and people are seated in the following order, from back to front:\n\n Window seat, odd-numbered.\n Window seat, even-numbered.\n Middle seat, odd-numbered.\n\nAnd so on. This way, if the passengers are efficient in stowing their luggage and seating themselves, the plane should be filled in the ideal time. It eliminates the buffers of climbing over already occupied seats and multiple people stowing in a line.\n\nCriticism \nSteffen's method has been criticised for not giving leeway to human imperfections and needs, including keeping together boarding groups\/children and adults, lateness, and organising large groups into a single file line ordered perfectly. Steffen said this was likely the reason no airlines have adopted his method.\n\nVariations \nDue to criticisms of the stress and required organisation of the method, some have suggested other sub-optimal boarding methods that don't take such a toll on human imperfections.\n\nSteffen realised the impracticality of the logistics of his method, and so devised a modified method, where people boarded in the order of:\n\n Right side, odd-numbered rows\n Left side, odd-numbered rows\n Right side, even-numbered rows\n Left side, even-numbered rows\n\nThis \"Steffen Modified\" method addresses the criticism of groups being split up, but is twice as slow as the optimal method.\n\nAnother speedy boarding method suggested is the Southwest method, which consists of people being able to choose where they want to sit. While not as fast as Steffen, this method has been shown to have been faster than the standard back-to-front method in controlled experiments.\n\nReferences \n\nPlanes"}

{"eng_Latn":"Lost Girls & Love Hotels is a 2020 American erotic drama film directed by William Olsson from a screenplay by Catherine Hanrahan, based on Hanrahan's 2006 novel Lost Girls and Love Hotels. The film stars Alexandra Daddario as an American English teacher in Tokyo, who loses herself to the city's nightlife and begins an affair with a member of the Yakuza gangs. It was released through video on demand on September 18, 2020, by Astrakan Film AB.\n\nPlot\nMargaret is an American expatriate living in Tokyo. She works at a Japanese academy during the day teaching prospective flight attendants how to pronounce English. She spends her nights getting drunk with fellow expatriates Ines and Liam, and seeks out submissive sexual encounters with random men in the city's numerous love hotels. Her misadventures cause her to sometimes show up to work in a daze and disheveled, drawing the concern of her manager, Nakamura. However, Nakamura sees something of her younger self in Margaret and is sympathetic.\n\nOne day, Margaret crosses paths with a Yakuza enforcer named Kazu, and the two begin a relationship. Margaret is at first taken aback by Kazu's revelation that he is about to get married, but she continues with him after he admits that his marriage is more out of duty than love. Margaret confides to Kazu that she does not have a family: her father left when she was a child, her mother died from cancer, and she has a schizophrenic brother. She came to Japan to be alone.\n\nOn the day of graduation for Margaret's students at the flight academy, Kazu asks Margaret to spend the entire day with him in Kyoto. Initially reluctant to skip graduation, Margaret agrees when he says he will not get another day, and they take the train. He brings her to the Kiyomizu-dera temple and shows her the \"Buddha's womb\", a stone illuminated at the end of a pitch-black tunnel. Kazu explains the symbolism of being reborn by reaching the stone and says that he has brought Margaret there hoping to help her let go of her trauma; but Margaret seems unaffected. On the train ride back to Tokyo, Kazu leaves the train while Margaret is asleep, leaving her despondent and desperate to find him when she wakes up. When she returns to work the next day, she finds that she has been dismissed and replaced.\n\nMargaret spirals down further when Ines reveals to her that she is leaving Japan. Following numerous meaningless sexual encounters, Margaret spots Kazu with his family by chance one day and follows him into a love hotel. Kazu reprimands Margaret for following him, telling her nothing can happen between them. When Margaret insists that she loves him, they have sex one more time before he sends her away, leaving him saddened and conflicted. When Margaret returns to her apartment she finds an eviction notice. She desperately takes a job as a bar hostess for drunken businessmen, but finds herself unable to participate and leaves without getting paid.\n\nNow homeless and at rock bottom, Margaret is found on the street by Liam's girlfriend Louise, who reveals that Liam has been deported. After sharing a drink with Louise, Margaret gets drunk and begins wandering around Tokyo aimlessly at night until she notices of a strange man following her. She asks him to take her to a love hotel. She tells him that she likes to be submissive. On his orders she strips naked and lies down, the stranger then tieing her hands and feet to the bed. When he suggests that he could kill her, she begs him to do it, but Kazu comes into the room to rescue her, having followed her. Grateful for being rescued, Margaret decides to start anew by leaving Tokyo. On the plane, Margaret notices Tamiko, one of her former students, as one of the flight attendants and they smile at each other while Tamiko demonstrates safety procedures before the plane takes off. Margaret calls Kazu to tell him she now understands the symbolism of the \"Buddha's womb\" and finally feels reborn, saying goodbye to him for good.\n\nCast\n Alexandra Daddario as Margaret\n Takehiro Hira as Kazu\n Carice van Houten as Ines\n Andrew Rothney as Liam\n Misuzu Kanno as Nakamura\n Yasunari Takeshima as Used\n Kate Easton as Louise\n Haruka Imo as Tamiko\n\nProduction\nIn December 2009, it was announced that Kate Bosworth would produce and star in Lost Girls and Love Hotels, based on the 2006 novel by Catherine Hanrahan.

{"eng_Latn":"David Black was educated at the University of St Andrews. He was admitted to the ministry of the church (on the recommendation of Andrew Melville) as minister of St Andrews in November 1590. Having offended James VI by \"certain unreverent, reproachfull and infamous speeches in his sermons\", he was summoned before the Privy Council on 18 November 1596, but declined its jurisdiction \"in matters spiritual\". In this he was supported by \"his whole brethren of the ministrie\". Twelve days later he lodged a second declinature, but was found guilty on 2 December, and \"the penaltie referred to the King's will and pleasure\". On 9 December he was ordered to enter his person in ward. The Synod of Fife petitioned the King to restore Black to his charge, but that was not done, and he was translated, and admitted to Arbirlot in 1597. He was presented to the vicarage by James VI on 15 May 1598. \"While on his way to Perth he died suddenly at Dundee, of apoplexy, immediately after having given thanks at a meal, Tuesday 12 January 1603. He had preached and dispensed the Communion on the preceding Sunday.\n\nPolitical setting\nWith principles so opposite to the spirit of freedom and of the Scottish church, it is not surprising that James and the presbyterian ministers should have been perpetually at variance. The clergy, jealous of their religious rights, openly and vehemently denounced the king's proceedings from the pulpit; and the king, on the other hand, threatened all with civil pains who ventured to condemn his measures, or question his authority as supreme potentate of the church. \"There would never be peace,\" he said, \"till the marches were rid between them.\" Determined, however, to \" rid the marches'\"' in his own person, he summoned one of the most zealous of their number, Mr. David Black, minister of St. Andrews, to answer before the privy council, for certain treasonable speeches, as he termed them, which he had uttered in the pulpit. Black, in his own name, and in that of his brethren of the ministry, sent in a declinature to the council, denying their authority to sit as judges of his doctrine, in the first instance or till he was tried by the church courts. They saw clearly that this prosecution was put out as a feeler to ascertain how far the church would yield; and, to use their own language, they feared \"that their yielding on this occasion would be held as an acknowledgment of his majesty's jurisdiction in matters that are mere spiritual, which might move his majesty to attempt further in the spiritual government of the house of God, and end in either a plain subverting of the spiritual judicature, or at least a confounding thereof with civil, if at any time profane and ambitious magistrates might by such dangerous beginnings, find the hedge broken down, to make a violent irruption upon the Lord's inheritance; which the Lord forbid.\" (Declinature of the King and Council's Judicature in Matters Spiritual, &c., by Mr. David Black, 18 November 1596.) This struggle for the liberties of the church issued, as might have been expected, in the defeat of the weaker party, and Black was banished from St. Andrews. The king was afterwards so far reconciled to Mr. Black, as to allow his admission into the vacant parish of Arbirlot.\n\nIt was the delight of James, however, to gain his object by policy rather than violence; and at length, by a series of stealthy, manoeuvres, which he dignified with the name of kingcrafty he succeeded in overturning the presbyterian polity. His first attempt of this nature was made shortly after this, when he requested the assembly to appoint some of their number, with whom he might advise respecting affairs in which the church might be interested; and the assembly rashly complied, appointing fourteen ministers to act as commissioners for the church. \"This,\" says James Melville, \" was the very needle which drew in the episcopal thread.\" Next year, the king stole another step towards his purpose, by prevailing upon the parliament to declare that prelacy was the third estate of the kingdom, and that such pastors as he pleased to raise to the dignity of bishops should have a right to vote in parliament. The next step was to prevail on the church courts to allow their commissioners to enjoy this enviable privilege. The commissioners themselves do not seem to have been unwilling to comply; and they endeavoured to persuade their brethren that his majesty's, object was merely to maintain the dignity of the ministerial office, and in nowise to bring in the popish or Anglican bishops. But the more clear-sighted saw through the stratagem and protested against it.\n\nCharacter\nHe is characterised as a man of singular fidelity and diligence, mighty in doctrine, a powerful preacher, a zealous, faithful, and painstaking pastor, whose ministry was productive of much fruit. He was strongly opposed to Episcopacy.\n\nPersonal life\nHe married Katherine Prattie, who survived him, and had issue \u2014 Sarah, who with her mother was recommended to charity by the Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale 4 November 1659.\n\nBibliography\nBeg.

{"eng_Latn":"The Franklin Sport is a two seat sport and training biplane built in the U.S. in 1930. Several different engines, in the power range , were fitted. Two remained airworthy in 2011.\n\nDesign and development\n\nThe Sport is a single bay, unequal span biplane. Its wings are built around twin spruce spars and, like the rest of the aircraft, fabric covered. Upper and lower wings have the same chord and outward-leaning, N-form interplane struts between their spars provide a wide interplane gap of about . The upper wing is without dihedral but the lower, equipped with Frise ailerons, is set at 2\u00b0. Both wings are rectangular in plan out to rounded tips though the upper wing, held centrally over the fuselage on a cabane, has a semi-circular cut-out to increase the pilot's upwards field of view.\n\nAll the Sport variants were powered by one of three types of five cylinder radial engine, nose-mounted on a frame which allowed easy exchanges between types. The fuselage has a flat-sided steel tube Warren girder structure with two open cockpits, one between the wings and the other just aft of the upper trailing edge with an extended, faired headrest. It is normally piloted from the rear seat, though the forward cockpit also has flight controls. Some instruments like the fuel gauge are visible from either seat. At the rear the tail also has a steel tube structure. The tailplane and elevators are mounted on top of the fuselage and the fin and unbalanced rudder have a rounded profile.\n\nThe landing gear is fixed and of the split axle type, with mainwheels on V-struts from the central fuselage underside and with vertical oleo struts from the outer axle to the wing leading edges, where single bracing struts connect to the upper fuselage longerons. A short tailskid is mounted on the extreme rear fuselage.\n\nOperational history\n\nThe Sport prototype, powered by a  Velie M-5 engine, first flew on 27 January 1930. After tests this was abandoned and production aircraft had either a  M-5 (Sport A, 8 built) or a  Lambert R-266 (Sport 90, 6 built) engine.\n\nThe histories of most of these club aircraft is uncertain.

{"eng_Latn":"Parada Harahap (born 1899 in Sipirok, Dutch East Indies, died 1959 in Jakarta) was an important journalist and writer from the late colonial period and early independence era in Indonesia. In the 1930s, he was called the \"king of the Java press\". He pioneered a new kind of politically neutral Malay language newspaper in the 1930s which would cater to the rising middle class of the Indies.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nParada was born on December 15, 1899, into a Batak family in Pargarutan, Sipirok, South Tapanuli Regency, Dutch East Indies, now part of North Sumatra province in Indonesia. Although most Batak people are Christians, Harahap was a Muslim Batak. He was largely self-taught and an enthusiastic reader from a young age, mainly reading materials sent to him by his sister who lived in Bukittinggi. However, he did also get a formal education, studying at the Teacher's Training School (Kweekschool) in Bukittinggi. At the age of 15 he became a clerk at a rubber plantation Rubber Cultuur Mij. Amsterdam in the Jambi area of Sumatra. During his teen years he gained an interest in newspapers, subscribing to Pewarta Deli and Andalas, and often writing letters to Soetan Palindoengan, editor of Pewarta Deli.\n\nNewspaper career\n\nHarahap's career in newspapers started in 1918 when he became editor of Sinar Merdeka in Padang, as well as editor of a Batak language paper in Sibolga called Poestaka. During this time he was also active in the Sarekat Islam in Padang.\n\nIn 1922 Harahap relocated from Sumatra to Java. He started as a low-level printing assistant at Sin Po in Batavia. With the recommendation of some Sumatran journalist notables, he then became head editor of a competing paper, Neratja. There, he learned a lot about the business from Abdul Muis, Agus Salim and Djojosoediro. After 9 months there he launched his own newspaper, Bintang Hindia.\n\nHe soon expanded his news holdings, founding the wire service Algemene Pers en Nieuws Agentschaap (Alpena). He then founded a series of new papers: Bintang Timoer, Djawa Barat, Sinar Pasundan, Semangat, as well as Dutch-language De Volks Courant. Of those papers, Bintang Timoer, launched in September 1926, quickly became the most successful, not least due to the popular writing of Abdoel Rivai. Even before its first issue, the Dutch language newspaper Algemeen handelsblad voor Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb was already recommending it to \"the natives\" due to Harahap's reputation for hard work and dedication to good journalism. The editorial lineup in the first year, aside from Harahap, were G. Soetadipradja, Kadar, Hatnid and Abdullah Badjrei. The paper noted that Bintang Timoer would be independent of any religious or political faction, and that it had a more modern layout than most Malay language papers, with illustrations and more space given to content. Since the paper was not involving itself in politics, it even promised that while \"the importance of Indonesia will be kept in mind, since no party interests are served, Indonesia will be understood as a 'geographical concept' not in the meaning of a 'political concept'.\" That type of statement symbolizes his attitude in the late 1920s and 1930s, that newspapers are a business not a political movement, and accepting Dutch rule in the Indies rather than using the newspaper to fight it.\n\nDuring this time Harahap involved himself in Indies journalism in many important ways. In 1924 he translated the Dutch penal code sections about journalism from Dutch into Malay. In 1925 Harahap also helped organize a new association for Asian journalists in the Indies called the Journalistenbond Azie (Associations of Journalists of Asia). Mohammad Tabrani from Hindia Baroe and Kwee Kek Beng from Sin Po were on the executive board, with Wage Rudolf Supratman as chairman.\n\nBintang Timur, his newspaper, apparently resumed publication in early 1953 after being unable to publish during World War II and the Indonesian National Revolution. Under its new guise in independent Indonesia, Harahap became president-director and head editor, and promised that the paper would have a \"national progressive\" line and to present the news in a responsible and neutral manner.\n\nIn 1956 Harahap was appointed dean of a new college for journalism and political science in Jakarta, the Perguruan Tinggi Ilmu Kewartawanan dan Politik or Akademi Wartawan, supported by the Yayasan Ibnu Chaldun, a foundation run by various Muslim figures in the city.\n\nHarahap died on May 11, 1959, in Jakarta.\n\nSelected works\n\n Roos van Batavia : atau Gadis terpeladjar jang bebas merdeka (1924)\n Journalistiek (pers- en spreekdelichtenboek) (1924)\n Riwajat Dr. A.

{"eng_Latn":"History according to the Catholic Church is the theological interpretation of humanity's and Israel's past as recorded in the Bible, the present times, and the future of the world by the Catholic Church. It is not the same as a timeline of the Catholic Church or an ecclesiastical history of the Catholic Church, but the church's perspective on history - in other words, a combination of Catholic origin myth and eschatology. In academic theology, the field of Church history develops and contributes to the Catholic Church's understanding of history. The church believes its foundation by Jesus marks the end-times, because Judaism believes that the messiah will come in the end-times. While the church accepts much of the Jewish interpretation of the Old Testament - the existence of God, divine inspiration, the exodus to the promised land, Babylonian captivity, etc. - the church does not agree with everything Judaism believes. The church interprets many scriptural events literally (whereas Judaism interprets them symbolically), applies the messianic prophecies to Jesus (whereas Judaism discounts certain scriptural verses as messianic prophecies and rejects Jesus' claims to messiahship and divinity), and applies Jewish self-identity to the church. For example, where Judaism believes that the world was created for the sake of Israel, the church teaches that the world was created for the sake of the New Israel (the church itself); and where Judaism is centered on God and his Torah, the church is Christocentric (since Christ is believed to be God and his Word). This article divides Catholic perspectives into two pieces: official interpretations, as presented in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, and unofficial interpretations, as presented by certain media.\n\nOfficial interpretation\n\nPast\n\nPre-Creation\nBefore creation, God predestined Jesus and his whole life, the Virgin Mary his mother, the church, each person to enjoy the beatific vision, the universal destination of goods, and all of creation to be renewed. God did not predestine man to die, and \"predestines no one to go to hell.\"\n\nCreation\nThe world was created in a \"state of journeying\" to its predestined renewal, and its creation is the first step toward God making a covenant with his people. After the sin and fall of the angels, Satan tempts Adam and Eve to sin and fall; but God promises mankind a redeemer. God only permitted the fall of the angels and men to display his power and love. That said, the church interprets the creation accounts in Genesis symbolically.\n\nSalvation history\n\nSalvation history is the history of revelation. God progressively revealed to his people creation, himself and the resurrection. By his promise to Abraham to make him the father of believers, God redirects human history from death to life. By accepting God's promise, Abraham inaugurates the salvation history that will culminate in Jesus. The passover, the exodus from Egypt, the giving of the Torah, and the covenant with his people begin to fulfill God's promise to Abraham. Salvation history includes a number of blessings - the \"birth of Isaac, the escape from Egypt (Passover and Exodus), the gift of the promised land, the election of David, the presence of God in the Temple, the purifying exile, and return of a 'small remnant'\" - that reveal how, from the beginning to the end of time, God's work is a blessing.\n\nTimes of the promises and preparations\nThe times of the promises and preparations is the time when God promised to send his people a redeemer and prepared his people for said redeemer. God spoke through the prophets, who summoned his people to repentance, and, unlike the other mitzvot that were written by Moses, God wrote the Decalogue.\n\nFullness of time\nThe fullness of time is the time of fulfillment of God's promises to and preparations of his people. The Virgin Mary is the culmination of God's preparation of his people for the messiah via her Immaculate Conception, Perpetual Virginity, and becoming the Theotokos. The Annunciation inaugurates the fullness of time. The conception of Jesus in Mary's womb inaugurates the end-times and the messianic age.\n\nHour of glory\nThe hour of glory is the hour of Jesus and the hour of the New Covenant: the Paschal Mystery. The Paschal Mystery is historical, yet transcends time by being made present in the Eucharist. The descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost fulfills the Paschal Mystery and inaugurates the age of the church.\n\nPresent\n\nAge of the church\nThe age of the church is the age of the resurrection of Jesus and the age of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.  The church is the beginning of the kingdom of God that will come in its fullness at the second coming. The second coming is hastened every time the Eucharist is celebrated, and every time a Christian prays for Jesus to come and lives according to the mind of Jesus. The Assumption of Mary is an anticipation of the future resurrection.\n\nFuture\n\nSigns that proceed the second coming\nThe second coming is suspended until Jesus is recognized by \"all of Israel,\" and until the church undergoes a final test by the antichrist.\n\nSign of the antichrist\nThe antichrist will be the supreme pseudo-messianism that claims to solve everyone's problems at the cost of apostasy. It will cause the final persecution of the church. The antichrist is foreshadowed throughout history by secular messianisms and millenarianism.\n\nSecond coming of Jesus\nThe second coming of Jesus will happen on the last day. It will bring about the resurrection and judgment of mankind. The judgment of mankind will reveal each person's good and evil deeds and will reveal the ultimate meaning of history and creation, how God led everything to its goal, and how God's justice surpasses every injustice and God's love surpasses death.\n\nUnofficial interpretation\n\nPast\n\nCalculation of creation and Christmas\nThe Anno Mundi is sometimes used by Catholics to determine the date of Christmas.\n\nDeicide\nJewish deicide is not accepted by the church. The church teaches that not Jews, but all sinners, are \"the authors and the ministers\" of Jesus' passion and death.\n\nPresent\n\nChastisement\nCertain alleged private revelations, such as Our Lady of Akita and Our Lady of Medjugorje, claim mankind is undergoing a chastisement for its sins.\n\nSix Ages of the World\nAugustine of Hippo believed the world is divided into six ages, with the fifth age being the contemporary age and the sixth age beginning at the second coming.\n\nFuture\n\nSigns that will proceed the second coming\nAccording to the Catholic Encyclopedia, Judgment Day will be proceeded by the return of Elijah and Enoch, a number of natural disasters, and a supernatural fire that will renew creation.\n\nIdentity of the antichrist\nSome church fathers, such as Irenaeus and Hippolytus, taught that the Antichrist will be a Jew from the tribe of Dan. Thomas Ice argues that the Antichrist will be a gentile.\n\nSee also\n List of private revelations approved by the Catholic Church\n Criticism of the Catholic Church\n\nReferences\n\nWestern culture\nCatholic Church\n \nHistoricity of the Bible"}

{"eng_Latn":"Mary Margaret Grieve  (11 April 1906 \u2013 19 February 1998) was a Scottish magazine editor and journalist. She began her journalistic career working for local newspapers and specialised magazines before being appointed editor of Woman magazine in 1937. Grieve was made its associate editor not long after before returning to the position of editor in 1940, which she held until her early retirement in 1962. She led a group of editors who advised the Home Office on woman's duties during the Second World War. In retirement, Grieve authored two books offering tips for school-leaving girls and co-ran a P\u00e2t\u00e9 making company.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\nGrieve was born at 3 Blackburn Road in Ayr, Ayrshire on 11 April 1906. She was the youngest daughter and the second child of the fundholder Robert Grieve and the nurse Annie Craig, n\u00e9e Stark. Grieve spent most of her childhood bedridden due to illness, and was home-schooled until the age of 16, when she briefly attended a small Glasgow daily school, and then in Edinburgh. At age 17, she spent time in Switzerland, and went to a London secretarial college to learn shorthand and typing.\n\nCareer\nUpon her return to Glasgow, Grieve sought independence, and worked on advertising for the Scottish Women's Rural Institutes's publication Scottish Home and County, and briefly edited the monthly magazine Scottish Nurse. She later worked as a freelancer for the next seven years for the women's picture paper The Bulletin, where she provided a new emphasis to women's features, and covered local happenings. Grieve authored the fictional book Without Alphonse: The Diary of a Frenchwomen in Scotland under the pseudonym \"Ursula Mary Lyon\" in 1935.\n\nIn 1936, she heard from her younger brother and a friend of his of a vacancy, and was summoned to be interviewed in London. She made the editor of Woman monthly magazine that was first published in July 1937. Grieve became the associate editor of Woman the same year following its owner Odhams Press bringing in the editor of Mother magazine to take over her former position. When the magazine's male editor joined the Royal Air Force in 1940, she once again was appointed editor. During the Second World War, Grieve led a group of editors who advised the Home Office on the role of women in the war. They argued against conscription women into the armed forces and persuaded the Home Office women contributed to the war effort by keeping communities and families united, and the men fighting for their wives and children would be demoralised if they believed their homes were divided. Grieve's lobbying led the government to exempt women from conscription. She and a friend used a stirrup pump while working as an air raid warden in London during The Blitz.\n\nGrieve's success as editor of Woman magazine was based on how she understood her audience and scarcely featured the wealthy and well-known figures since their community was different to others and inaccessible at the time. She featured practical advice for food and established practical departments to demonstrate and test goods in the post-austerity era. Grieve sought to reach as many women across the United Kingdom as possible and encouraged reader participation by letter or telephone. From 1952 to 1960, she was a member of the Council for Industrial Design. Grieve was appointed to the National Council for Diplomas in Art and Design in 1960 and the council of the Royal College of Art three years later. \n\nFollowing the purchase of Odhams Press by Daily Mirror Group for \u00a338 million in 1961, Grieve made the decision to retire early in December 1962. In retirement, she wrote an autobiography, Millions Made my Story, in 1964. Grieve was asked by Collins to edit two books containing tips for school-leaving girls when the leaving age was raised to 16. They were the textbooks Fifteen in 1966 and Sixteen in 1967. She and a friend operated a P\u00e2t\u00e9 making company Dove Delicacies she supplied to local restaurants and shops. Grieve continued to run the business until she suffered a major stroke in 1978.\n\nPersonal life\n\nGrieve received the OBE for \"services to journalism\". On 19 February 1998, she died at her home in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. She did not marry.\n\nLegacy\n\nAccording to Martin Pugh in the book Women and Women's Movement in Britain, 1914\u20131959, Grieve \"clearly thought\" herself to be an \"emancipated\" woman and \"not as mere tools in the hands of male power brokers.\" He noted she defended herself by arguing she followed market demands of her magazine.\n\nReferences\n\n1906 births\n1998 deaths\nPeople from Ayr\n20th-century Scottish women\n20th-century Scottish women writers\nWomen magazine editors\nScottish magazine editors\nScottish women editors\nScottish women journalists\nScottish journalists\nOfficers of the Order of the British Empire"}

It was built around the chassis, wheels, and steam pipes of an EFS locomotive, with a new boiler, water tank, cabin, rear bogie, and firewood bunker, assembled in a workshop at Usina Monte Alegre. It used a  gauge, and weighed 150 tonnes, with a pulling capacity of 1300 tonnes. It was named Dona Joaninha after Dona Joana Morganti, who owned the workshop. It was inaugurated in January 1940.\n\nOperation \nThe locomotive was used to move sugar cane on the Usina Tamoio private railroad, in Araraquara, which ended at the Tamoio station near S\u00e3o Carlos. It was in use until the line closed in the mid-1960s.\n\nStatic display \nAfter the line closed, the locomotive was kept on the railroad's premises until around 1976, when it was purchased by a scrap dealer based in Guarulhos. After being moved there, the scrap dealer partnered with the Guarulhos city hall to put the locomotive on display around 2000 in Pra\u00e7a IV Centen\u00e1rio (now known as Pra\u00e7a Paschoal Thomeu), which is at the former location of the Guarulhos Station of the Cantareira Tramway.\n\nWhile on display in the park, it fell into disrepair, with a tree falling on the chimney, denting it, along with rust and decay due to a lack of maintenance. It is not protected against people climbing on it. Originally painted green when it was installed in the park, it turned black, and then multicoloured through graffiti. Nearby Portuguese pavement was left as a rubble heap. The local government started seeking private funding to repair the locomotive in 2017.\n\nRestoration work started in July 2020, funded by local companies, with coordination by the Secretaria de Meio Ambiente (Sema) but with no funding from the city. Rusted parts were replaced, the chimney repaired, and graffiti removed, before it was repainted and lights installed. It was also enclosed by railings.\n\nReferences \n\nSteam locomotives of Brazil\nGuarulhos\nMetre gauge steam locomotives\n2-6-4 locomotives"}

{"eng_Latn":"Benjamin Maximillian Mehl (November 5, 1884 \u2013 September 28, 1957), usually known as B. Max Mehl, was an American dealer in coins, selling them for over half a century. The most prominent dealer in the United States, through much of the first half of the 20th century, he is credited with helping to expand the appeal of coin collecting from a hobby for the wealthy to one enjoyed by many.\n\nMehl was born in Congress Poland, which was part of the Russian Empire. His family brought him to what is now Lithuania, and then to the United States, settling in Fort Worth, Texas, where he lived for almost all of his adult life. While still a teenager, he began to sell coins, which he had previously collected. Joining the American Numismatic Association (ANA) in 1903 at age 18, he quickly became a full-time coin dealer, and by 1910 was one of the most well-known in the country.\n\nDuring his half-century of coin dealing, his customer list included Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Colonel E. H. R. Green. He sold coins from the collections of important numismatists (coin collectors) at auction, including Jerome Kern and King Farouk. Mehl was the first dealer to advertise in non-numismatic publications, helping to broaden the appeal of the hobby. He claimed to have spent over a million dollars on advertisements offering to buy a 1913 Liberty Head nickel for $50, though he knew there were none in circulation to be found. This got the public to search through their pocket change looking for rare coins that Mehl might buy, and greatly increased sales of Mehl's coin books, adding to his profit.\n\nMany of his great auction sales took place in the 1940s, but by the following decade, he was becoming less active, and he died in 1957; his business continued into the 1960s. Mehl was elected to the Numismatic Hall of Fame in 1974, and to the CoinFacts Dealer Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nEarly life \n\nBenjamin Maximillian Mehl was born on November 5, 1884, in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, in what was then Congress Poland within the Russian Empire. His parents, Solomon Isaac Mehl and Rachel Mehl, lived in the Jewish Quarter of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, known as Altstadt. Mehl means \"meal\" (as in ground grain, or flour), and in a time and place when last names were often descriptive of the family trade, the Mehls may have been itinerant millers. Rachel Mehl's last name at birth was Goldstick.\n\nIn 1885, the Mehl family, including Benjamin, moved to Vilkomu, in the province of Kovno (modern day Kaunas, Lithuania). There was a growing Jewish community, and Benjamin received his initial education in its school. According to a 1906 biographical sketch, he collected coins from early childhood, and was unable to recall a time when he was not interested in them.\n\nSeeking greater opportunities, in 1895 the Mehl family, including Benjamin, immigrated to the United States, arriving there in April of that year. They initially lived in New York, and settled for a time in Denton, Texas before moving to Fort Worth, likely because Rachel Mehl had family there. Benjamin was educated in the public schools of Fort Worth. A synagogue was built in Fort Worth in 1895, which the Mehls joined; sometime around 1897, Benjamin was called to the Torah as a bar mitzvah. While attending school, Benjamin, along with his three older brothers and one older sister, was employed in the clothing store Solomon Mehl opened at 1211 Main Street in Fort Worth. He left school at age 16 and became employed full-time as a clerk at the store.\n\nFrom the age of 10, Benjamin collected cigar bands, then stamps, then coins. He dated his start as a coin dealer to 1900, likely with unusual coins taken from the cash register with his father's approval as part of his pay. In June 1903, he applied to become a member of the American Numismatic Association (ANA), giving the Main Street address, and using the name \"B. Max Mehl\"\u2014he would never use his first name in print. ANA Secretary George F. Heath noted in the ANA's journal, The Numismatist, that the thirteen applicants that month had ages ranging from 18 (Mehl's age) to 65, describing the applications as progress towards the time when every reputable coin collector or student of numismatics belonged to the ANA, adding, \"the fires in the Temple of Numisma burn on and on forever.\" In listing the collecting interests of the applicants, Heath stated that Mehl \"collects only U.S. Colonial and Territorial gold and paper money\". Each application was subject to no objection being lodged against the prospective member, and Mehl was approved, becoming ANA member number 522 on July 1, 1903.\n\nEarly career (1903\u20131920) \n\nMehl's first published words in The Numismatist appeared in August 1903. Likely part of a letter to Secretary Heath endorsing the magazine, they read, \"I am indeed more than pleased with The Numismatist and think it is the best publication of its kind.\" In October 1903, that journal reported a change of address for Mehl to Box 24, Alvord, Texas. In 1903, he joined the British Numismatic Society. Mehl's first mail-order advertisement appeared in the December 1903 issue of The Numismatist, selling 33 U.S. coins on a highest-bidder basis. Q. David Bowers, in a 1999 article on Mehl, found it logical that Mehl would focus on the mail order business given Fort Worth's distance from numismatic centers such as New York and Philadelphia\u2014there would be few local collectors to patronize a coin shop in \"Cow Town\", as Fort Worth was known. By this time Mehl had returned to using the address on Main Street in Fort Worth. The sale was likely not a success, as most of the coins were listed on a circular Mehl sent by mail in January 1904, but the following month, he placed his first full-page advertisement in The Numismatist. According to numismatic author John N. Lupia III, \"Apparently he was a smashing success from 1904 on.\" Mehl was aided in becoming a major coin dealer by C.W. Cowell, a Coloradan who was selling his collection, who sent many rare pieces to Mehl on consignment, allowing him to offer rarities that otherwise would have been beyond his means.\n\nThe February 1904 advertisement offered The Hub Coin Book for sale for $.25 (), although in an unfortunate misspelling in the ad, the \"k\" in Book was rendered as a \"b\". This book, published by Alexander & Co. of Boston, was widely-sold, and coin dealers could order copies imprinted with their name and address for sale to the public for a small fee. Mehl did so, and sent out copies advertising himself, seeking to promote his business. In 1906, he published the first edition of The Star Coin Book: An Encyclopedia of Rare American and Foreign Coins, sold for ten cents and heavily copied from The Hub Coin Book. Heath described The Star Coin Book as a \"well illustrated sixty-four page pamphlet giving prices he pays for coins, particularly the American series, and much other valuable information\". Beginning in 1908, Mehl published the more thorough The Star Rare Coin Encyclopedia, which by 1924 had an annual sale of 70,000 copies. These sold for $1 (the price later increased) to members of the public who were hopeful of picking a valuable coin out of their pocket change.\n\nMehl did not limit himself to advertisements in the numismatic press. Beginning in 1904, he placed classified ads in the Fort Worth Telegram. In 1906, he became the first coin dealer to advertise in the national non-numismatic press, with five lines in Collier's magazine, at an expense of $12.50. This proved successful as an advertising strategy, helping to transform coin collecting, once a niche hobby for the wealthy and for students of art and archeology, into a pastime for the masses. \n\nIn 1906, Mehl came east for the first time, visiting New York and the coin business of Lyman H. Low for his first coin auction, where he proved an active participant. Numismatist Farran Zerbe commented on Mehl's youth. Mehl also visited Boston and Philadelphia. In July 1906, he wrote to his customers that he was now a full-time coin dealer, something that likely came as a surprise to many of them, who assumed that he had long been one. According to Bowers, \"by 1910, his innovative advertising and colorful personality projected him to the first rank of dealers.\"\n\nBy 1907, Mehl had opened his own office at 1309 Main Street in Fort Worth. On August 18, 1907, Mehl and Ethel Rosen married, in the parlor of Ethel's uncle, Northside Fort Worth developer Sam Rosen. Ethel Mehl's family also had roots in Lithuania. They had two daughters, Lorraine and Danna.\n\nIn January 1908, Mehl began to publish Mehl's Numismatic Monthly, with guest contributors including some of the leading numismatists of the day. Published until 1919 with a hiatus in 1911\u20131912, according to Bowers it \"gave The Numismatist a run for its money and in many aspects was more interestingly edited\". When Heath, the editor of The Numismatist, died unexpectedly in 1908, Mehl offered the Numismatic Monthly as a replacement journal for the ANA, but Zerbe took over The Numismatist and continued it. In 1912, Mehl moved to New York to join fellow dealer Wayte Raymond in a partnership. Mehl was concerned about his relative isolation in Texas from the rest of the numismatic world. However, after only a few weeks, Mehl returned to Fort Worth, writing in The Numismatist that serious illness in his family had required his return, and personal matters then obliged him to remain. He stated that he had re-established himself on as large a scale as before.\n\nIn 1916, Mehl engaged local architect Wiley G. Clarkson to design a three-story, 16,000-square-foot office building of brick, ornamented with stone bas-reliefs of antique coins. Located at 1200 W. Magnolia Avenue, the building was the working place of Mehl and 40 employees (an increase from 10 in 1912) who dealt with correspondence and orders from a subscription list of 70,000 customers. In the years to come, these would include Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and King Farouk of Egypt.\n\nMehl was one of the largest dealers in early United States commemorative coins, and the only one to make them a major part of his business in the 1916\u20131920 era, including Columbian half dollars in groups and packets of coins sold to beginning collectors. When the promoters of the 1916- and 1917-dated McKinley Birthplace Memorial gold dollar failed to sell many coins to the public at the original issue price of $3, Mehl purchased about 10,000 (half the extant mintage) at just over face value, selling them to the public at less than the issue price well into the 1920s. Mehl similarly acquired (from Zerbe, the coin's promoter) thousands of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollars and sold them to his customers. In late 1919, Mehl stated that he had an advertising budget of $5,000 per year, and he continued to advertise in non-numismatic publications, spending $200 () on a single insertion of an advertisement in The American Boy.\n\nMiddle years (1920\u20131940) \n\nIn 1921, Mehl sold his first 1804 dollar, one of the great rarities of American numismatics. He turned the sale to good account in his advertising, noting that he had paid over $2,000 () for an old silver dollar and wondering what rarities the reader might have undiscovered in their possession. The United States Post Office Department found this to be deceptive. Thereafter, Mehl switched campaigns, offering to buy any 1894-S Barber dimes (also extremely scarce) that the reader might have, at a time when common-date Barber dimes were everyday pocket change. During his career, Mehl sold six 1804 dollars, selling two of the six twice. Similarly, Mehl boasted of spending a million dollars advertising in vain to buy a 1913 Liberty Head nickel, knowing that none of these extremely rare coins were to be found in circulation. Though he bought many other coins as a result, his primary purpose was to promote the sale of his catalogue, and his campaign supposedly led to transit delays in some cities as trolley conductors checked through their change. His actual purchase, for $200, of a rare cent, was also advertised.\n\nIn his advertisements, Mehl urged collectors to sign up for his \"Mehl-ing list\". According to a 1929 article on Mehl, he was among the top five recipients of mail in Fort Worth, and during the busier part of the year, ranked second or third, though another source states he accounted for more than half of Fort Worth's incoming mail, leading the post office to put additional trucks on the Magnolia Avenue route. Despite his extensive dealings in coins, the 1929 article disclosed he did not himself collect them, feeling that he could not both collect and deal in coins; instead, he collected autographs. Both his auctions and his fixed-price coin sales were by mail-order only; if a prospective buyer showed up in Fort Worth, Mehl would discuss a purchase and even take the person to dinner, but would insist his guest return home and write to complete the purchase, stating he did not want anyone to feel under pressure to buy. From 1924 to 1926, Mehl served on the ANA's board of governors.\n\nIn the early 1930s, amid the Great Depression, hobbies prospered, including coin collecting. Mehl greatly expanded his campaign to sell coin books to the American public, who were receptive, liking the idea of finding a rare coin in those difficult times that might solve one's financial worries. Mehl purchased full-page advertisements in Sunday newspapers and had his own nationwide radio program, stating in 1933 that he had spent more than $50,000 () to advertise on more than 50 radio stations. A 1931 advertisement in The American Weekly, a Sunday newspaper supplement, cost him $18,500, while a $2,000 ad in The Saturday Evening Post brought in 9,800 book orders during the first week. Catering to both beginning and advanced collectors, Mehl worked for years to get the noted numismatist, Colonel E.H.R. Green, who made large coin purchases, as a customer; he was eventually successful and sold Green an estimated $500,000 worth of coins. His incoming mail peaked with 1.25 million pieces in 1935. Mehl proclaimed, in 1938, that he had $250,000 in capital, $500,000 in resources and \u201cthe largest numismatic establishment in the United States\". In 1939, Mehl employed 50 people, and boasted that he had more people on his payroll than all other U.S. coin dealers combined.\n\nDuring the commemorative coin boom of the 1930s, Mehl continued to push them, noting that they had gone up in value during the Depression years even as stocks sank. When representatives of the Arkansas Centennial Commission came to him in late 1935 after having sold out the year's issue of the Arkansas Centennial half dollar, Mehl advised them to get the Bureau of the Mint to agree to strike limited-edition varieties of the coin that could be resold to the public at high prices. The Mint refused, but did agree to strike more of the original coins, few of which were made available to the public, but were sold by Mehl at a premium above the issue price. In January 1936, with prices still rising for commemorative coins (the bubble burst near the end of the year), Mehl published an advertisement urging collectors to \"BUY NOW\u2014Potential $10 and $20 coins for a fraction of their near-future value!\" In 1937, Mehl published a booklet on commemorative coins.\n\nLater years (1940\u20131957) \n\nAccording to Bowers, \"in the decade of the 1940s, Mehl reached his glory.\" Mehl had 116 auction sales, all conducted by mail, between 1903 and 1955; those after 1940 included some that Bowers described as \"awesome and incredible\". Never a researcher, Mehl made exaggerations or errors in his catalogs that led to some criticism of him in the numismatic community.\n\nAmong the post-1940 sales were the William Forrester Dunham Sale (1941), Fred E. Olsen (1944, containing the first 1913 Liberty Head nickel Mehl ever handled, despite his advertisements), and the duplicates from the King Farouk collection (1947). The Dunham collection included an 1804 dollar and another great rarity, an 1822 half eagle, and Mehl sold another 1804 dollar in the 1946 William Cutler Atwater sale for a record-breaking price of $10,500. Mehl dubbed the sale of the Farouk coins the \"Royal Sale\", though only about six percent of the lots in the sale had been owned by Farouk. Unable to gain permission to illustrate the auction catalog cover with a portrait of Farouk, Mehl instead used an Egyptian coin that depicted Farouk, and which required no permission to display. Mehl also handled the auction of the coin collection of composer Jerome Kern (1950). Coin dealer Abe Kosoff wrote in Mehl's 1957 obituary in the pages of The Numismatist, \"Max was master of the finesse of cataloging.\"\n\nDuring World War II, Mehl was chairman of Fort Worth Draft Board #2. His other civic activities included being president of the Rotary Club and of the Exchange Club. He served as potentate of Moslah Shrine Temple, and sat on the board of the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce. He was a member of the Fort Worth Club, Colonial Country Club and Temple Beth-El. He received a humanitarian award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews, Fort Worth chapter, in 1956.\n\nBy the 1950s, Mehl's numismatic activities were diminishing. After the Kern collection in 1950 (which he styled his \"Golden Jubilee\" sale), he conducted only three more auctions, the last on October 25, 1955. B. Max Mehl died on September 28, 1957, having had a serious heart condition for some time, and was interred two days later, with Abe Kosoff as one of his pallbearers, in the Beth-El section of Greenwood Cemetery in Fort Worth.\n\nAftermath and assessment \n\nAfter Mehl's death, his executive secretary of over 40 years' service, Mary Ellen Ferguson, kept the firm going until her own death in 1961. Thereafter, Kosoff, who managed Mehl's numismatic estate, offered the trade name for sale for $25,000. Kenneth Nichols of Costa Mesa, California bought it, and set up the B. Max Mehl Co. He later sold the firm to George Nichols of Beverly Hills. It continued to run advertisements in The Numismatist until July 1966, thereafter fading from active business.\n\nBowers described Mehl as \"America's most famous rare coin dealer of the first half of the 20th century\u00a0... [who] was a promoter of coins and arguably did more to advance the hobby than any other individual of his time\". According to numismatist Pete Smith, \"Mehl is remembered as one of the great dealers and promoters for the hobby.\" Daniel C. Parker called Mehl \"the father of modern coin collecting\u00a0... he more than anyone before or since that time popularized our hobby. He brought it out of the affluent man's domain and made it a hobby for all ages and economic strata.\"\n\nMany of his contemporaries dubbed Mehl \"the P.T. Barnum of numismatics\". Tom LaMarre wrote, \"Mehl sold more than coins, he sold an image. Ads featured the Mehl building, Mehl standing in front of his luxurious home, or other scenes intended to depict the dealer as a coin tycoon.\" Charles D. Horning wrote in 1995, \"Mehl was truly a phenomenal self-promoter.\" Parker stated, \"Mehl had a fantastic knowledge of human nature. Had he come along 40 or 50 years later, he would have made a fortune on Madison Avenue.\" Jay Guren, in a 1979 article in Coin World, agreed: \"Mehl was a numismatist and much much more. He was a super promoter and comprehended human psychology to a T.\" Kosoff remembered, \"Whatever he did, he did with a flair and a touch of class. It was always the biggest and the best or some other superlative.\"\n\nANA life member Walt Southward wrote in a 2004 article on Mehl that the dealer \"achiev[ed] the status of hobby icon during the 1920s and '30s, he received numerous accolades, from the ANA and others, as he spent many thousands of dollars promoting the hobby. He was credited with being a tremendous advocate for coin collecting, using newspaper and magazine ads and radio programs to spread the word.\" Mehl was inducted into the ANA's Numismatic Hall of Fame in 1974, and, in 2010, was part of the six-member inaugural grouping inducted into the CoinFacts Dealer Hall of Fame, established by the Professional Coin Grading Service.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1884 births\n1957 deaths\nAmerican Jews\nPolish Jews\nAmerican numismatists\nPolish numismatists\nAmerican people of Polish-Jewish descent\nEmigrants from the Russian Empire to the United States\nPeople from Fort Worth, Texas\nPeople from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a\nPeople from Piotrk\u00f3w Governorate"}

{"eng_Latn":"Gallyon Gun & Rifle Makers Ltd (formerly known as  Gallyon & Sons) is a British gunmaker currently based in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, England, which offers bespoke sporting shotguns and rifles.\n\nThe company was established by William Gallyon in Cambridge, in 1784. Gallyon Gun & Rifle Makers is a member of the Heritage Crafts and has held several Royal Warrant.\n\nHistory\n\nGun making by the Gallyon family began in the late 1700s when William Gallyon [1758-1838], a descendant of a family of glaziers, was apprenticed to John Henshaw, a well-known London trained gunmaker. Henshaw completed his training in London and became a member of the Worshipful Company of Gunmakers, a London Guild, and became a Freeman of the City of London. Henshaw worked and traded in London before moving to Cambridge around 1746. \nIn 1784 William Gallyon had left the employment of John Henshaw and had established his own gun making business in Cambridge. John Henshaw died on 7 February 1796 and within his will & testament, he directed his kinsman, James Henshaw, an ironmonger from London, to sell and dispose of the business, along with all the stock in trade and working goods; these were bought by William Gallyon.\n\nIn 1939 Gallyon & Sons bought the business of Lionel Clough based in King's Lynn, a business which had its origins in 1800 with M. Spencer, gunmaker. In 1860 the business was sold and transferred to J.M. Boreham, and then 10 years later to John Young's Potter.\n\nIn 1868 Gallyon & Sons leased premises at 66 Bridge Street in Cambridge, and eventually purchased the property in 1888 from St John's College, Cambridge.\n\nIn 1955, Gallyon & Sons of King's Lynn was granted a Royal Warrant of appointment to Queen Elizabeth II, having previously held those for kings Edward VII, George V and George VI.\n\nOn 1 April 1951, Gallyon & Sons purchased the business of Charles Francis, gunmaker of Peterborough. Charles Francis established his gun making business in long causeway, Peterborough, during the early 1800s. The business traded as Charles Francis & Son from 1951 until 1 March 1964, when the company was incorporated and became Gallyon & Sons (Peterborough) Ltd.\n\nIn 1964, Gallyon & Sons acquired another British gunmaker, C.S. Rosson, from its founder, Charles Stanley Rosson. In 1906 Charles Stanley Rosson came to Norwich from Derby, where he, his father and older brother had worked as gunmakers. Charles purchased an old established gunmaking business from Cartwright & Wilson, and quickly built up a reputation for very high-quality guns, that were valued and exported worldwide. \nSituated originally on the corner of \u2018Rampant Horse Street\u2019, a location which was bombed and destroyed during the Second World War, with the loss of the historical C S Rosson gun ledgers.\n\nGallyon temporarily took over what remained of the business after the bombing as an act of kindness to Charles, offering to \u2018Caretaker\u2019 the business until Charles was able to take back the running of the business. Gallyon returned the business back to C.S. Rosson in 1947, which was then re-established in \u2018White Lion Street\u2019, Norwich. After the Second World War and with the loss of the original archival gun records, the first recorded gun in the new ledger was dated 2 February 1946. The gun was given the serial number 4501. \nRosson gun records normally show the date which the gun was finished, in some cases this was the date of the final engraving or sale to the customer. Rosson use several brand names, which denoted the level of quality. The top of its range was Eclipse, followed by Norfolk, County, Expert, Acme and finally Covert. In the early 1950s the business moved to 'Bedford Street' where Charles ran the business until 1956 when he died.\n\nThe Rosson business was then sold to Stuart Healy's of London and after three years the business went bankrupt.\n\nThe business was then sold at auction to H.P. Darlow, a wholesale arms and ammunition merchant from Bedford. Darlow tried to run the business unsuccessfully from his remote Bedfordshire office, until in November 1964 Gallyon agreed to buy the gunmaking business, with Darlow retaining the cartridge business. The takeover of the Rosson business was completed on 1 April 1965 and the Rosson name was retained for six months, then in 1966 it was changed to Gallyon & Sons (Norwich) Ltd.\n\nMore than 26 000 sporting guns have been manufactured by the company since the companies foundation in 1784 up to 2017.\n\nIn 2017, Quiller Press published a limited edition of \"Gallyon and Sons: Gunmakers of East Anglia\", a book written by Richard Gallyon and Wendy Trott about the history of Gallyon Guns.

{"eng_Latn":"Sundial is a  mountain summit located within Olympic National Park, in Jefferson County of Washington state. Sundial is part of The Needles range, which is a subrange of the Olympic Mountains. Its nearest higher neighbor is Mount Clark,  to the northwest, and Mount Johnson is set  to the west. The climbing routes on Sundial start at class 3 scrambling via the East Face, and range up to class 5 via the South Side Face. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1944 by Adel and William Degenhardt. The mountain is so named because the time of day can be approximated as an observer in Royal Basin watches the sun's rays make their way down the east face of this mountain in the morning. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into Royal Creek which is a tributary of the Dungeness River.\n\nClimate\n\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Sundial is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing or viewing this peak.\n\nGeology\n\nThe Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\n\n Martin Peak\n Mount Walkinshaw\n Geology of the Pacific Northwest\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Sundial weather:  National Weather Service\n\nOlympic Mountains\nMountains of Washington (state)\nLandforms of Olympic National Park\nNorth American 2000 m summits"}

He played college football at San Francisco.\n\nCollege career\nHall originally attended Duquesne University on a basketball scholarship. He played both basketball and football for two seasons before joining the Army Air Force during World War Two. In 1942, he rushed for a 60-yard touchdown to beat Villanova in a 6\u20130 upset victory. Hall played football for the Fourth Air Force's football team and eventually went to the East-West Shrine Game as the branch's representative. After the war, Hall enrolled at the University of San Francisco using the GI Bill and joined the San Francisco Dons football team. In his first season with the team, Hall set an NCAA record with 36.2 yards per kickoff return and was named All-Pacific Coast by the Associated Press.\n\nProfessional career\nHall was selected in the ninth round of the 1945 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles while still in the military. After graduating from San Francisco, Hall signed with the San Francisco 49ers of the All-America Football Conference.

{"eng_Latn":"Asebeia (Ancient Greek: \u1f00\u03c3\u03ad\u03b2\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) was a criminal charge in ancient Greece for the \"desecration and mockery of divine objects\", for \"irreverence towards the state gods\" and disrespect towards parents and dead ancestors. It translates into English as impiety or godlessness. Most evidence for it comes from Athens.\n\nThe antonym of asebeia is eusebeia (\u03b5\u1f50\u03c3\u03ad\u03b2\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1), which can be translated as \"piety\". As piety was the generally desired and expected form of behaviour and mindset, being called and regarded impious (\u1f00\u03c3\u03b5\u03b2\u03ae\u03c2) was already a form of punishment.\n\nTrials in Athens\n\nEvery single citizen, including a third party, could bring this charge (graph\u0113 asebeias) to the Archon basileus. Instead of a single law or text defining the charge and proceedings to take place in case of asebeia, there is an array of texts in which it appears. Plutarch, Polybios, Demosthenes and Aristotle refer to it in their texts.\n\nThe trials were publicly held at the Heliaia and were split into two steps: first it was established by the audience (heliasts or dikastes) through voting, whether the accused was found guilty; if the majority found them guilty, because the laws didn't prescribe a fixed punishment, the audience at the Heliaia would then, in the second step, decide on the punishment. Known punishments were fines, exile, death, property confiscation and atimia (disfranchisement), whilst death was the most common sentence. There was no right to appeal the sentence made. Sentences were carried out or supervised by the magistrates from the eleven tribes: The Eleven (\u03bf\u1f31 \u1f15\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1). The following ancient Greeks were accused or allegedly accused (as the sources are ambiguous) of asebeia:\n Aeschylus (acquitted)\n Anaxagoras (acquitted, exiled, or sentenced to death in absentia)\n Andocides was acquitted in 399 or 400 BCE.\n Aristotle (fled before trial)\n Aspasia (acquitted)\n Hermocopidae:  vandalizers of the Athenian hermae in 415 BCE. 22 individuals were sentenced to death.\n Alcibiades (sentenced to death, but fled)\n Demades (fined)\n Diagoras of Melos (fled Athens)\n Diopeithes\n Euripides\n Ninos\n Phryne (acquitted)\n Protagoras (allegedly sentenced to death or exile)\n Socrates: Found guilty after trial, sentenced to death, and executed in 399 BCE.\n Theodorus the Atheist\n Theophrastus (exile, later withdrawn)\n\nHistoricity\n\nEven though the above individuals were alleged to have been accused of asebeia in different later sources, there is a lack of historical evidence and it was suggested that some of the accusations might have been fabricated by historians and other writers in later periods.\n\nOutside Athens\n\nOutside Athens asebeia was possibly seen as a wrong state of mind rather than a crime.\n\nSee also\n Graphe paranomon\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n Filonik, J.

{"eng_Latn":"Spellbreak was a free-to-play, class-based third-person shooter video game developed by Proletariat for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, released on September 3, 2020.\n\nOn June 28, 2022, it was announced that Spellbreak would shutdown in early 2023. It was shut down on January 10, 2023.\n\nGameplay\n\nSpellbreak was a projectile-based PvP shooter, however, unlike other shooters, it used gauntlets that fired magical spells in place of guns. Additionally, players could levitate and carry one 'Rune,' giving access to abilities like flight, teleportation or invisibility. Players could choose from one of six elemental classes: wind, fire, ice, lightning, stone and toxic, which granted in game benefits related to that element. Each player started with their class gauntlet permanently attached to them and could pick up one of the other five as a secondary. Gauntlets could deal a primary attack, called a spell, and a secondary attack, called a sorcery. Spells were limited by Mana which was an energy pool shared with levitation, while using a sorcery triggered a cooldown timer. Elements from different gauntlets could be combined to make spells more powerful, provide crowd control effects, or reduce others, depending on strategic desires. According to the developer the game also included role-playing and roguelike elements.\n\nGame modes included battle royale and Clash, a team deathmatch. With the release of Chapter 2 on April 8, 2021, Dominion, a 5v5 mode featuring control points would replace Clash.\n\nDevelopment\nThe core combat was inspired by old school shooters like Quake and Unreal Tournament. At the time the Battle Royale genre was and CEO Seth Sivak remembers thinking \"was really a competitive roguelike for people that didn\u2019t play roguelikes\" wondering \"Could we do a cool, interesting fantasy version of that and make it into something awesome? All the mean while finishing it up with in 2 years and with a team of 6.\u2019\" The setting was decided on after the team realized that most Battle Royale games were gun based and felt that they could produce a fantasy themed version of the genre. According to executive producer Cardell Kerr the game was initially more \"swords than sorcery\" although the balance would eventually switch. The gameplay was influenced by such games as Unreal Tournament and Quake, while the visual design was influenced by such animated movies such as Akira and Princess Mononoke as well the TV show Avatar: The Last Airbender. Further inspiration for the visuals came from games with \"gorgeous visual effects like 2D Castlevanias, League of Legends, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\"\n\nProletariat announced in late June 2022 that they would stop working on further updates for Spellbreak as they had been acquired by Activision Blizzard and were transitioning to incorporate into Blizzard Entertainment's team that is in charge of developing World of Warcraft.\n\nReception \nSpellbreak received \"generally positive\" reviews for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One and \"mixed or average\" reviews for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n2020 video games\nBattle royale games\nFantasy video games\nFree-to-play video games\nPlayStation 4 games\nUnreal Engine games\nWindows games\nXbox One games\nNintendo Switch games\nVideo games developed in the United States"}

{"eng_Latn":"Pavlos Rodokanakis (Greek: \u03a0\u03b1\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a1\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2, Italian: Paolo Rodocanachi; 29 May 1891 \u2013 16 May 1958) was an Italian-born Greek painter.\n\nBiography\nRodokanakis was born in Genoa in 1891 and came from a large wealthy family.\n\nHe started his artistic education as a student of Giuseppe Pennasilico (1861\u20131940) in his hometown. Later on he studied painting under Giulio Bargellini (1875\u20131936) and graphics under Vittorio Grassi (1878\u20131958) at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma (Academy of Fine Arts Rome).\n\nIn 1911 Rodokanakis made his debut at an exhibition of the Societ\u00e0 Promotrice di Belle Arti (Society for the Promotion of Fine Arts) in Genoa. He later moved to Greece, his parents' country.\nDue to the armed conflicts there during the First World War, the artist ended up in G\u00f6rlitz in 1916 as a soldier as part of the Greek IV Army Corps transferred to Germany. Although he lived in a barrack camp for two years, he managed to be productive creatively.\nHis efforts to distinguish himself as a painter resulted in an invitation to Munich in the summer of 1918. There, in Munich`s Glaspalast (Glass Palace), Rodokanakis took part in the annual art exhibition. The success in Munich led to another exhibition in the Stadthalle (town hall) G\u00f6rlitz in November 1918, which showed more than 50 of his works and which was extremely well received.\n\nAfter returning to Greece, Rodokanakis joined the artist group Omada Tehni (Techni Group), founded in 1917. This enabled him to take part in an art exhibition in Paris in 1919 that presented contemporary Greek art. This major showing was opened personally by the then Greek prime minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who was present due to peace negotiations in the French capital.\nIn the same year, a solo exhibition of some of the painter's works took place in the premises of the Athens daily newspaper Eleftheros Typos.\n\nIn the course of the Greco-Turkish War, Rodokanakis, along with the artists Spyros Papaloukas (1892\u20131957) and Periklis Vyzantios (1893\u20131972), took part in an anti-Turkish campaign as an official war painter between 1921 and 1922. The work of the three artists, which was created during this period and was briefly exhibited, was destroyed due to the acts of war in Smyrna and the great fire there in 1922.\n\nIn 1923 Rodokanakis left Greece for good and moved to his native town of Genoa. Back in Italy, he managed to establish himself as an important painter. In the following years, he participated in several exhibitions where either only his work was presented or his work was shown together with those of other artists.\nIn the years 1935, 1939, 1948 and 1952 he took part in the highly regarded national exhibitions of the Quadriennale in Rome. His participation in the Venice Biennale in 1934, 1940 and 1948, in which he represented either Greece or his chosen home Italy, received particular attention.\n\nRodokanakis was married to the translator and writer Lucia Rodocanachi (1901\u20131978), n\u00e9e Morpurgo.\n\nThe painter died in Genoa in 1958.\n\nWork\nThe oeuvre of Rodokanakis is mainly characterized by landscape depictions but also figure painting.\nThere are unmistakable references to symbolism and Art Nouveau, especially in his early creations. Many works have an impressionistic touch.\n\nHis typical painting style is an atmospherical, sometimes few opaque colorouring applied with a light brush stroke.\n\nWorks by him are for example kept in the National Gallery in Athens, in the Museum of the City of Athens, in the Leventis Gallery in Nicosia and in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna (National Gallery of Modern and Contemporary Art) in Rome.\n\nHonours\nIn Arenzano, a comune in the Metropolitan City of Genoa, a town square was named after the artist.\n\nReferences\n\nReferenced books\n Vollmer, Hans (Editor): Allgemeines Lexikon der bildenden K\u00fcnstler des 20.

During the Mexican Revolution, he moved to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, which had grown rapidly and gained a new strategic and economic importance during the war.\n\nIn Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez he attended El Colegio Palmore, a boarding school and business college that had moved to El Paso from Chihuahua City to serve the children of the exiled elite that had become concentrated in El Paso.  Mingling with the sons of prominent government officials and prominent regional political and commercial figures, he developed strong connections as he established himself as a future businessman, leaving for Los Angeles for a short period in order to attend Los Angeles Business College.\n\nReturning to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, he quickly established himself as a dominant figure in the commercial life of the city. Beginning with the financing of saloons and cabarets,  by 1927 he was running a wholesale whiskey operation displaced from Kentucky due to U.S. prohibition.   He soon enough had expanded to construction and amassed a veritable fortune, becoming one of the dominant actors in the city\u2019s economy and running the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez National Chamber of Commerce from 1927 to 1929, which was his first foray into public office. Marrying into the established Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Mascare\u00f1as family, and buying one of the estates of the famous Terrazas family, he firmly established himself as a new central figure within the region\u2019s business elite.\n\nHe then shifted to a focus on a political career. Prominent among city leaders and publicly successful in his management of the city's chamber of commerce, Berm\u00fadez became mayor of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in 1942, where he distanced himself from his past dealing with vice industries and campaigned as a moralizer against transgressions towards the city\u2019s rightful moral character, and in particular against prostitution. This successful stint as mayor was followed by an election to the position of senator from Chihuahua that was interrupted by his selection for the directorship of the state oil company Petr\u00f3leos M\u00e9xico (Pemex) between 1946 and 1958, where he presided over the modernization and vertical integration of the government\u2019s oil industry. With Pemex he had established himself as a firm proponent of the economic nationalism of the PRI. He described the work of constructing Ciudad Pemex, a development in Tabasco oriented towards the petroleum industry as \u201ca gigantic effort by Mexican society to overcome by technical means the wanton blind forces of nature in order to build a world capable of giving satisfaction to the highest needs of man.\u201d\n\nIn this period he was precandidate for the PRI nomination for Presidency and afterwards he served for three years as Mexican ambassador in the Middle East, returning only in 1961 to serve in the final public position of his life, director of the National Border Program (PRONAF).  Berm\u00fadez's brainchild, PRONAF sought to remake the border cities of the country in order to display the development of Mexican economy and culture, transform the dour reputation of the region, and capture greater shares of the cross border consumer market for Mexico. This program ultimately fell far short of its original intentions but helped kickstart the industrialization of the border region. To this day, the massive Antonio J. Berm\u00fadez Industrial Park in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez bears his name.\n\nReferences \n\nInstitutional Revolutionary Party politicians\n1892 births\n1977 deaths\nPoliticians from Chihuahua (state)\nPeople from Chihuahua City\nPeople from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez\nMembers of the Senate of the Republic (Mexico)\n20th-century Mexican politicians\nMunicipal presidents in Chihuahua (state)\n20th-century Mexican businesspeople"}

{"eng_Latn":"The Khalili Collection of Enamels of the World is a private collection of enamel artworks from the period 1700 to 2000, assembled by the British-Iranian scholar, collector and philanthropist Nasser D. Khalili. It is one of the eight Khalili Collections, each of which is considered among the most important in its field. \n\nThe most extensive private collection of its kind, it consists of over 1,300 pieces and showcases the evolution of enamelling over a 300-year period. By including objects from Western Europe, Russia, Islamic countries, China, Japan, and America, it shows how these centres of enamel production influenced each other's styles. The best-known European enamellists are represented, including Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9, Cartier, and Ren\u00e9 Lalique, along with the Meiji-era Japanese artists who perfected the firing process. The collection illustrates the role of patronage in enamelling as many of its objects were created for royal or imperial households. These include the enamelled chariot belonging to Bhavsinhji II, Maharaja of Bhavnagar and a painted enamel throne table with the seal mark of the 18th century Chinese Qianlong emperor. Other objects include presentation chargers, jewellery, miniatures and ornamental pieces. The collection was the basis for a 2010 exhibition at the Hermitage Museum.\n\nThe collection \nThe collection is one of eight assembled, conserved, published and exhibited by Khalili, each of which is considered among the most important in its field, according to UNESCO. Three of them contain enamels, the others being the Khalili Collection of Japanese Art and the Khalili Collection of Islamic Art. The enamels collection consists of over 1,300 pieces and showcases the evolution of enamelling over a 300-year period. It is the most comprehensive private collection of its kind.\n\nWorks\n\nEuropean works \n\nA range of enamelling techniques, including plique-\u00e0-jour, ronde-bosse, and basse-taille were used by European craftsmen from 1700 onwards. Watchmakers in Geneva and silver-workers in Augsburg integrated enamel decoration into their work. Limoges in France was a centre for painted enamel from the late 15th century onwards. French workshops developed polychrome techniques in the early 17th century, giving their works much greater realism, similar to watercolour and gouache portraits. Portraits on painted enamel, as a way of decorating small objects, became common until largely replaced by portrait photography. Other uses of enamel continued into the 20th century, with mass production used for many kinds of wares from the most mundane to award-winning artistic examples.\n\nThe collection's European works come from Paris, Geneva, and Vienna, among other locations, and include decorative boxes, containers and other ornamental items by artists including Ren\u00e9 Lalique, Jean-Valentin Morel, and Adrien Vachette. A surtout de table by Lalique has two cast bronze peacocks, using enamel to colour their feathers and crests. One item from Paris is a decimal clock with one face showing normal twelve-hour time, a Moon phase indicator, and another face showing decimal time, which was promoted in the aftermath of the French Revolution. Works from early twentieth century Paris include some from the Cartier jewellery firm and its contemporaries. The Cartier items in the collection include timepieces and small cases. Other Parisian enamellers represented include Van Cleef & Arpels, Lacloche Paris, and Jean Schlumberger. A silver and gold timepiece by Maison Vever was exhibited at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889 as part of a display that won a Grand Prix for jewellery design. Its decoration illustrates the four seasons, the signs of the zodiac, and the four elements.\n\nMany of the objects reflect the patronage of Europe's royal families. A silver-gilt casket dated 1897 was commissioned by Queen Elisabeth of Romania as a gift for the artist Jean-Jules-Antoine Lecomte du Nou\u00ff. With champlev\u00e9 enamel portraits and engraved text suggested by the Queen, it celebrates creativity and genius. A gold almanac was commissioned by Marie Louise, Empress of the French and comes in a leather case stamped with the French Imperial Eagle. It has an allegorical depiction of the birth of Napoleon II attended by Minerva, Cupid, Mars and Victory. A gold watch with chatelaine by Charles Oudin commemorates the wedding of Am\u00e9d\u00e9e de B\u00e9jarry, a French count. A desk set celebrates the engagement of Crown Prince Umberto of Italy and Archduchess Mathilda of Austria. A ewer with painted enamel was a wedding gift for William, Prince of Hohenzollern and Princess Maria Teresa of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. The European enamel paintings in the collection include a portrait of Marshal Turenne by the Geneva-born artist Jean Petitot who worked for the English court of Charles I as well as for the French court. \n\nEnglish enamels were typically not signed, making identification of artists difficult, but the collection includes vases with the mark of George Richards Elkington and several other English works. The English artist Henry Bone was known for especially large enamel portraits. His works in the collection include portraits of Queen Victoria, Queen Charlotte, and Royal Navy captain William Hoste. Other portraits depict George III, Lord Raglan, William Kent, and Hugh Chamberlen the younger. Other paintings in the collection have religious or mythological subjects, including work by Charles Boit and George Michael Moser. Still life and landscape art are also included.\n\nIn the late 19th century, technological advances allowed for painted enamel panels of a much greater size than what could previously be produced. The collection includes a  high depiction of the Crucifixion of Jesus in a Renaissance style which is the largest known single-piece enamel painting. Thought to be by Paul Soyer of Limoges who is responsible for similar large paintings, this was likely commissioned as a gift for the Vatican.\n\nThe collection includes many Swiss decorative boxes from the period 1785 to 1835. Geneva in the 18th century was successful at exporting jewellery and painted enamel, including gold snuff boxes, to the rest of Europe. Many boxes in the collection are decorated with miniature paintings, sometimes versions of well-known works. Subjects include Napoleon crossing the bridge at Arcole, the Judgement of Paris, Roman charity, the infant Christ, and Cupid disarmed by Euphrosyne. An inscription on one box indicates it was presented to the American artist George Catlin by Nicholas I of Russia in 1845. Another box is from the Royal House of Saxony and bears a double portrait of Prince Fernando (the future Fernando VII of Spain) and his wife Princess Maria Antonia of Naples and Sicily. One box by the artist Jean George R\u00e9mond shows a portrait of Louis XIV of France. Another box bears the mark of the firm of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bautte and Jean-Gabriel Moynier. Snuff boxes with miniature portraits of the monarch were common diplomatic gifts in 18th century Europe; an example in the collection bears a portrait of Francis I of the Two Sicilies. Mahmud II, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, also adopted this practice, and the collection includes a snuff box from Geneva with his portrait inside the lid.\n\nThe P. Bruckmann company of Heilbronn, Germany, exhibited at several international art exhibitions. The collection includes a silver wine cistern, 107\u00a0cm high, that was the centrepiece of their display at the Stuttgart exhibition of 1896. The cistern includes figures of Hedwig of Saxony and of Marie, the heroine of the novel Lichtenstein.\n\nRussian works \n\nSome works in the collection bear the mark of Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9 whose father had founded the House of Faberg\u00e9 in Saint Petersburg. Faberg\u00e9 acquired a reputation for enamel artworks of the highest quality and received commissions from the Russian Imperial family, as well as being awarded the titles of Master Goldsmith and Goldsmith by Special Appointment to the Imperial Crown. In the 1880s Faberg\u00e9 greatly expanded the range of colours and patterns of enamel surfaces, machining repeating patterns onto the underlying metal. His employees included the enamel artists Henrik Wigstr\u00f6m, Michael Perkhin, and Hjalmar Armfeldt who are represented in the collection. The collection's objects from the House of Faberg\u00e9 include timepieces, cases, frames, and a fan combining lace and gauze with silver, gold, and painted enamel.\n\nAn independent enameller who supplied filigree enamel to Faberg\u00e9 was Feodor R\u00fcckert. R\u00fcckert's style changed dramatically during his career, at first imitating other artists then developing his own distinctive decorative style. The collection has works from before and after this change.\n\nA bread and salt-dish given to President \u00c9mile Loubet of France by the residents of Tsarskoye Selo in Russia in May 1902 bears the arms of Tsarskoye Selo and cypher of Empress Elizabeth I.\n\nIslamic works \n\nAt the start of the Islamic calendar in 622 AD, artisans of the Byzantine Empire were already making high quality enamels. Byzantine emperors gave luxury items to Muslim rulers in the 10th and 11th centuries and these would often be decorated with cloisonn\u00e9. The influence of Byzantine art is visible in objects from the Fatimid Caliphate, Egypt, Syria, and Muslim Iberia. The historian Jack Ogden has argued Iran was producing champlev\u00e9 enamelwork by the 14th or 15th century, but very few examples survive.\n\nChamplev\u00e9 enamel flourished in the Mughal Empire, especially during the reign of Shah Jahan in the 17th century, where it was used for personal jewellery, luxury objects and containers including hookahs. In the 19th century, Jaipur was known for enamels rivalling those of Europe or Iran, especially red transparent enamels, while Lucknow was known for blues and greens and Benares for painted enamels. Delhi and Calcutta also produced enamels but seem not to have had their own regional style. The Jaipur red enamel is exemplified in the collection by an ornamental dagger with scabbard and by a gold necklace. In the Mughal period, enamel was only used to decorate functional objects, but in the 19th century purely decorative enamel wares were produced. The collection includes both kinds of object. A silver Landau carriage in the collection was commissioned in 1915 by Bhavsinhji II, Maharaja of Bhavnagar and was kept by his family until 1968 for use in special events.\n\nEnamel production in Iran dates from at least the early Safavid period in the 14th century and flourished during the Qajar period (1785\u20131914), whose artisans had a strong preference for gold as a base. Niccolao Manucci, an Italian writer and traveller who visited the Safavid court in 1655, noted Shah Abbas II employed a team of French enamellers and supervised their work. By the late 17th century there was an official position of Court enameller. By the end of the 18th century Iranian enamellers had mastered painted enamel, and were adding it to a wide variety of items for ordinary citizens as well as for royalty. The collection has several items from the Qajar period, including a silver-gilt hookah with portraits of people in Iranian and Western dress.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the court of Ottoman Turkey had adopted the European convention of gifting decorative objects, with relevant emblems, as marks of favour. An example in the collection is a brooch with the name of Abdul Hamid II spelled out in diamonds. The collection has some objects commissioned by the Ottoman Empire from European artists. These include snuff boxes from Geneva and Paris depicting Mahmud II and a Bosporus landscape, one bearing the name of Muhammad Ali of Egypt in diamonds.\n\nJapanese works \nJapanese artists did not start producing cloisonn\u00e9 enamel until the 1830s, coinciding with the sharp fall in the Shogun's power, and followed by the Meiji Revolution, but their techniques advanced quickly. By the 1870s, enamel art works were being exhibited at national exhibitions and at world's fairs. From 1870 to 1900, the form went through a very rapid evolution which introduced translucent colours, dark black backgrounds, and smoother surfaces without cracks or pitting. New techniques included  (\"piling up\") which places layers of enamel upon each other to create a three-dimensional effect,  or  which creates panels of transparent or semi-transparent enamel, and  (), in which the metal foundation is hammered outwards to create a relief effect. \"Wire-less\" cloisonn\u00e9 or  was introduced by Kawade Shibatar\u014d and taken up by other artists. Namikawa S\u014dsuke created pictorial enamel works so similar to paintings they were shown in the painting section of the Japan\u2013British Exhibition, rather than the craft section.\nThe period from 1890 to 1910 was known as the \"Golden age\" of Japanese enamels. At this point they were regarded as unequalled in the world in their breadth of designs and colours.\n\nThe collection includes works by, among other cloisonn\u00e9 artists, Namikawa S\u014dsuke, Namikawa Yasuyuki, Ando Jubei, and Hattori Tadasabur\u014d all of whom were appointed Imperial Household Artists. It also includes works by Kawade Shibatar\u014d who, like the others, is also represented in the Khalili Collection of Japanese Art. Some vases bear the sixteen-petaled chrysanthemum seal of the Imperial family, indicating they were commissioned as presentation wares. The  hidden-wire technique is evident on some items and others have the distinctive black background Namikawa Yasuyuki was known for. The  relief technique is visible on a vase by Kawade Shibatar\u014d. Hayashi Kodenji, Kawaguchi Bunzaemon, and Kumeno Teitaro are other artists represented.\n\nChinese works \n\nCloisonn\u00e9 enamels on copper surfaces have been made in China since at least the early 15th century, building on a tradition of fired enamels that goes back much further. After its introduction, the technique developed rapidly. During the Qing dynasty, enamel artists used thinner wires and fired the enamel without pitting or bubbles, greatly improving on previous Chinese cloisonn\u00e9. They also introduced a wider range of colours. From 1720 onwards, pink, white and yellow enamel overglazes were used on porcelain, cloisonn\u00e9, and painted enamels. Cloisonn\u00e9 works included objects created for temples or for the imperial court.\n\nThe Chinese enamels in the Khalili collection date from the late Qing dynasty onwards. They include items made for temple altars, such as incense burners and candlesticks. Among the imperial works is a throne table, 90.5 centimetres (just under three feet) long, made for the Qianlong Emperor and bearing his seal. It is painted in fine detail with motifs of lotus and flying bats on a background of imperial yellow. Evenly firing such a large object would have presented a challenge, so the colourful and consistent result illustrates the skill of the Guangzhou workshops where it was made. Another imperial commission in the collection is a wall panel of a springtime landscape, with a poem by Yu Minzhong. A set of eight wall panels, 132 centimetres (52 inches) high and each featuring a different plant, illustrates the progress of the seasons. Each bears a Yu Minzhong poem, probably written as calligraphy and then converted to enamel.\n\nExhibitions \nA selection of 320 objects from the collection formed the exhibition \"Enamels of the World 1700\u20132000 from the Khalili Collection\" from December 2009 to April 2010 at the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, Russia. The museum director Mikhail Piotrovsky wrote that the collection \"includes spectacular masterpieces from all the major centres of enamelling\" and \"reveals the remarkable technical achievements of the enamellers[.]\" Art dealer Geoffrey Munn described the diversity of the exhibition as \"astounding\", observing Khalili \"hasn\u2019t followed the clich\u00e9d routes of enamel.\"\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \n\n Official website\n Video: Prof Mikhail Piotrovsky, director of the State Hermitage Museum, talks about the Enamel of the World Exhibition\n\nVitreous enamel\nEnamels of the World"}

{"eng_Latn":"Surp Krikor Lusavori\u00e7 Armenian Church (, ) is an Armenian Apostolic church dedicated to Saint Gregory the Illuminator in Kuzguncuk, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, Istanbul, Turkey. It was rebuilt in 1861.\n\nHistory\n\nA wooden church building was constructed for the Armenian community in Kuzguncuk by the court architect Ohannes Amira Serverian during the time of Armenian Patriarch Stepanos III of Constantinople () and was opened on 11 May 1835. According to an inscription, the current church, funded by Bedros Agha Shaldjian, was rebuilt in 1861 and replaced the wooden building. The church is across the passenger-ferry pier of Kuzguncuk in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar district on the Asian coast of Bosphorus in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nArchitecture\nStrict rules of construction and renovation imposed by the Ottoman Empire are seen as the cause for the lack of architectural aesthetics of Armenian churches in Istanbul built mostly during that era. The Surp Krikor Lusavori\u00e7 Armenian Church in Kuzguncuk makes an exception with its cruciform plan, Byzantine dome, and reliefs.\n\nThe rectangular-plan church building with walls of unhewn stone and double rows of brick has three sections and a narthex. The dome on the roof is supported by four pillars. The church has five doors, one main entrance and two doors at each side. Three large windows on each side of the building and over the main entrance illuminate the interior. On the northern and southern walls, there are Byzantine-style pseudo windows decorated with paintings of saints. The building is also lit by skylights in the semi-dome to the east. The vaulted main entrance is flanked by a room with an apse on each side. The apse is roofed by a semi-dome. An Armenian inscription in five lines is over the main entrance, and an Armenian prayer is inscribed on the large arch. A painting of Saint Gregory the Illuminator is on the left interior wall behind the main entrance. The altar's upper part is gilded. The wooden guard rail in front of the altar is decorated with flower and leaf figures made by Kalust Agha Kemhacyan, who provided timber to the Sultan's court. In 1944, a stairway was built to the chair gallery on the northeast side.\n\nThe two-story belfry with a pyramidal roof surmounted by a cupola is immediately behind the apse in the east. A fountain was added to the churchyard in 1910. In 1967, ornaments were added to the church's interior.\n\nUpon an inscription, the church underwent a restoration between 2003 and 2004. It was reopened in 2005 after consecration by Armenian Patriarch Mesrob II Mutafyan of Constantinople ().\n\nNext to the northern wall, a preacher of the church Episcope Hovhannes Setyan (1800\u20131875) is buried.\n\nSchool\nIn 1853, a co-educational school named Lusavori\u00e7yan was established in a building on the same land with the church to meet the educational needs of the growing Armenian population in the Kuzguncuk area.\n\nSocial activities\nThe small neighborhood of Kuzguncuk has a multi-religious community. In addition to the Armenian church, there is the Agios Georgios Greek Orthodox Church, the Agios Panteleimonas Greek Orthodox Church, the Bet Nissim Synagogue, and the \u00dcryanizade Mosque close to each other. A group of Christian, Jewish, and Muslim students and adults visited the church in February 2008 as part of a social activity organized by the local women residents of the three religions.\n\nThe church is often visited by schools as well as by domestic and foreign tourists.\n\nReferences\n\nArmenian Apostolic churches in Istanbul\nChurches and monasteries of Constantinople\n19th-century Eastern Orthodox church buildings\n1861 establishments in the Ottoman Empire\n\u00dcsk\u00fcdar\nBosphorus\n19th-century churches in Turkey"}

The structure, in its astronomical angle, is dense in five known places including one very near to the celestial South Pole and is, according to the international team of astronomers that discovered the South Pole Wall, \"...the largest contiguous feature in the local volume and comparable to the Sloan Great Wall at half the distance ...\". Its discovery was announced by Daniel Pomar\u00e8de of Paris-Saclay University and R. Brent Tully and colleagues of the University of Hawai\u02bbi in July 2020. Pomar\u00e8de explained, \"One might wonder how such a large and not-so distant structure remained unnoticed. This is due to its location in a region of the sky that has not been completely surveyed, and where direct observations are hindered by foreground patches of galactic dust and clouds. We have found it thanks to its gravitational influence, imprinted in the velocities of a sample of galaxies\".\n\nSize\nThe wall measures over 1.37 billion light-years in length, and spans a large zone 500 million light-years away.

{"eng_Latn":"In astronomy, an odd radio circle (ORC) is a very large (over 50 thousand times the diameter of our Milky Way ~ 3 Million Light-years) unexplained astronomical object that, at radio wavelengths, is highly circular and brighter along its edges.  As of 27 April 2021, there have been five such objects (and possibly six more) observed. The observed ORCs are bright at radio wavelengths, but are not visible at visible, infrared or X-ray wavelengths. This is due to the physical process producing this radiation, which is thought to be synchrotron radiation. Three of the ORCs contain optical galaxies in their centers, suggesting that the galaxies might have formed these objects.\n\nDescription \n\nThe ORCs were detected in late 2019 after astronomer Anna Kapinska studied a Pilot Survey of the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU), based on  the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope array. All of the ORCs are about 1 arcminute in diameter, and are some distance from the galactic plane, at high galactic latitudes. The possibility of a spherical shock wave, associated with fast radio bursts, gamma-ray bursts, or neutron star mergers, was considered, but, if related, would have to have taken place in the distant past due to the large angular size of the ORCs, according to the researchers. Also, according to the astronomers, \"Circular features are well-known in radio astronomical images, and usually represent a spherical object such as a supernova remnant, a planetary nebula, a  circumstellar shell, or a face-on disc such as a protoplanetary disc or a star-forming galaxy, ... They may also arise from imaging artefact around bright sources caused by calibration errors or inadequate deconvolution. This class of circular feature in radio images does not seem to correspond to any of these known types of object or artefact, but rather appears to be a new class of astronomical object.\"\n\nSee also \n Fast radio burst\n Gamma-ray burst\n Radio lobes of radio galaxies\n Gravitational wave\n Baryon acoustic oscillations\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Images of ORCs (CTA Observatory \/ Western Sydney University; 04\/20\/2020)\n  (Anton Petrov; 07\/15\/2020)\n  (Mr. Researcher; 07\/10\/2020)\n  (World Today; 07\/09\/2020)\n\nAstronomical events\nRadio astronomy\nStellar phenomena\nUnexplained phenomena\nUnsolved problems in astronomy\n2020 in science"}

As with other disciplines of Zen philosophy such as yoga and taichi,  you feel a whole internal energy. It serves as a defense technique, but also to improve your health.\n\nKata\nYasunari Ishimi created his own Kata Chanan Dai, which is an assembly of the five Pinan kata.

Adela, Katy, Ikke, Mischa, Simone and Werner moved to the  Forest.\n : Since the housemates broke several rules the Castle was closed and everyone lived in the Forest.\n\nArena\n\nMatch Arena\nThe housemates from the poor \"Fairy Tale Forest\" area compete in the \"Outdoor Match Arena\" in order to earn additional money for shopping at the supermarket.\n\n Big Brother decide who would face the match\n The housemates decided who would face the match\n\nDuel Arena\nIn addition to the Match, there are also Duels against each other.\n\nNominations table\n\nNotes\n\n : For the first time in history of Promi Big Brother, the viewers were given the power to determine which housemates are nominated for the eviction. Claudia and Udo had the fewest votes and were nominated. The remaining housemates decide which one of them will be evicted.\n : Before the voting Claudia and Udo, as the nominees, played a game in the Duel Arena and the winner would pick a housemate that his\/her vote would not count. Udo, as the winner, picked Elene and her vote didn't counted.\n : As a punishment for breaking Big Brother's rules, Elene and Jenny were automatically put up for eviction by Big Brother. Jenny voluntarily left the house on Day 8 prior to the eviction. Elene saved herself from eviction by winning a challenge. Werner received the most votes in a vote count and was therefore saved from eviction.\n : Ramin won the Bottle Shake duel against Ikke, therefore all Castle housemates were immune from eviction.\n : Emmy and Sascha won the duel, therefore all Castle housemates were immune from eviction and they didn't nominate.\n : Aaron and Ikke faced off in the duel, in which Aaron won immunity. By losing, Ikke was automatically up for eviction. Only male housemates were allowed to be nominated in face-to-face nominations.\n : After Sascha's eviction, housemates were told to rank themselves who deserved winning the most. The housemates ranked last automatically gets nominated. Aaron was ranked last, so he is nominated for eviction.\n : As the result of that night's Duel, Simone received a killer nomination and Katy received immunity. Both could opt to give it to another housemate not already nominated. Simone and Katy chose to keep it for themselves. \n : As the result of that night's Duel Werner could save one teammate and he chose Katy while Kathy had to decide which teammate would be nominated immediately. She chose Ramin.\n : As the result of that night's Duel the votes of the men counted twice.\n : One day before the final two housemates had to leave the house. After the match Katy, Mischa and Werner won a second vote for the first nomination of the night.\n\nRatings\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial Homepage\n\n2020 German television seasons\n08"}
{"eng_Latn":"Yitzhak of Volozhin (also known as Rabbi Yitzhak ben Chaim of Volozhin, Rabbi Itsele Volozhiner, and HagRIts; 1780 \u2013 16 June 1849) was a rosh yeshiva of the Volozhin Yeshiva.\n\nBiography \nYitzhak was born in 1780 in Volozhin, Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth to rabbi Chaim Ickovits of Volozhin. As Rosh Yeshiva, his father taught him in the Volozhin Yeshiva, making him one of his closest desciples in Torah.\n\nYitzhak would later become a teacher there during his father's lifetime and inherit the position of Rosh Yeshiva after his father's death. He would also name the yeshivah Eitz Chaim in honor of his father. He would earn the acronym HagRIts, Hagaon Rabbi Itskhak, according to rabbi Baruch Epstein. He would continue to operate the yeshiva after it was officially closed by government authorities in 1824, making a name for himself as a misnaged figure.\n\nIn 1843 Yitzhak would attend a government convened conference on reforming Jewish education. The government, under the leadership of Tsar Nicholas I and Minister of Education Count Sergey Semionovich Uvarov, sought to push russification on the Jewish population through their agent Max Lilienthal. In the face of this, Yitzchak defended the Orthodox position, alongside leaders such as the Third Lubavitcher Rebbe, and would make a positive impression on Count Uvarov. Where the Lubavitcher Rebbe was putting up a desperate defense, claiming that the Jewish people's spiritual concerns supersede the Czar's government, Yitzhak presented the misnagdim as fearful of being brushed aside by the government and made attempts to achieve concessions from the Russian government without surrendering Jewish identity and values. Yitzchak argued that public school would be a danger to Jewish upbringing and that the Jewish people needed more political rights. \n\nYitzhak died on 16 June 1849 in Ivenets. Rabbi Eliezer Fried, the husband of one of his daughters, would succeed Yitzhak as Rosh Yeshiva. Rabbi Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin, a second son in law of Yitzhak, would succeed Rabbi Fried.\n\nReferences \n\n1780 births\n1849 deaths\nVolozhin rosh yeshivas\n19th-century rabbis from the Russian Empire\nBelarusian Orthodox rabbis\nPeople from Valozhyn"}

It was first described as a tribe by Simon in 1889, then raised to the subfamily Anaminae of the family Nemesiidae, before being raised to a family level by Opatova et al. in 2020.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe tribe Anamini was first described by Eug\u00e8ne Simon in 1899. In 1982, Barbara York Main distinguished the tribe Teylini from the tribe Anamini by technical differences, including a narrow band of cuspules on the maxillae and the absence of a spine-bearing spur on the first tibia of males (except in Teyloides). A molecular phylogenetic study in 2018 found that Anamini excluding Teylini was not monophyletic, and so merged the former Teylini into Anamini, placing the tribe in the subfamily Anaminae of the family Nemesiidae.

{"eng_Latn":"In network theory, link prediction is the problem of predicting the existence of a link between two entities in a network. Examples of link prediction include predicting friendship links among users in a social network, predicting co-authorship links in a citation network, and predicting interactions between genes and proteins in a biological network. Link prediction can also have a temporal aspect, where, given a snapshot of the set of links at time , the goal is to predict the links at time .\nLink prediction is widely applicable. In e-commerce, link prediction is often a subtask for recommending items to users. In the curation of citation databases, it can be used for record deduplication. In bioinformatics, it has been used to predict protein-protein interactions (PPI). It is also used to identify hidden groups of terrorists and criminals in security related applications.\n\nProblem definition \nConsider a network , where  represents the entity nodes in the network and  x  represents the set of \"true\" links across entities in the network.\nWe are given the set of entities  and a subset of true links which are referred to as observed links.\nThe goal of link prediction is to identify the unobserved true links.\nIn the temporal formulation of link prediction the observed links correspond to true links at a time , and the goal is to infer the set of true links at time \nUsually, we are also given a subset of unobserved links called potential links , and we need to identify true links among these potential links.\n\nIn the binary classification formulation of the link prediction task the potential links are classified as either true links or false links.\nLink prediction approaches for this setting learn a classifier  that maps links in  to positive and negative labels i.e. . \nIn the probability estimation formulation, potential links are associated with existence probabilities. \nLink prediction approaches for this setting learn a model  that maps links in  to a probability i.e. .\n\nSingle link approaches learn a model that classifies each link independently. \nStructured prediction approaches capture the correlation between potential links by formulating the task as a collective link prediction task. \nCollective link prediction approaches learn a model that jointly identify all the true links among the set of potential links.\n\nLink prediction task can also be formulated as an instance of missing value estimation task.\nHere, the graph is represented as an adjacency matrix with missing values. \nThe task is to complete the matrix by identifying the missing values.\nMatrix factorization based methods commonly use this formulation.\n\nHistory \nThe task of link prediction has attracted attention from several research communities ranging from statistics and network science to machine learning and data mining. \nIn statistics, generative random graph models such as stochastic block models propose an approach to generate links between nodes in a random graph.\nFor social networks, Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg proposed a link prediction models based on different graph proximity measures.\nSeveral statistical models have been proposed for link prediction by the machine learning and data mining community.\nFor example, Popescul et al. proposed a structured logistic regression model that can make use of relational features.\nLocal conditional probability models based on attribute and structural features were proposed by O\u2019Madadhain et al.\nSeveral models based on directed graphical models for collective link prediction have been proposed by Getoor.\nOther approached based on random walks. and matrix factorization have also been proposed \nWith the advent of deep learning, several graph embedding based approaches for link prediction have also been proposed.\nFor more information on link prediction refer to the survey by Getoor et al. and Yu et al.\n\nApproaches and methods \nSeveral link predication approaches have been proposed including unsupervised approaches such as similarity measures computed on the entity attributes, random walk and matrix factorization based approaches, and supervised approaches based on graphical models and deep learning.\nLink prediction approaches can be divided into two broad categories based on the type of the underlying network: (1) link prediction approaches for homogeneous networks (2) link prediction approaches for heterogeneous networks.\nBased on the type of information used to predict links, approaches can be categorized as topology-based approaches, content-based approaches, and mixed methods.\n\nTopology-based methods \nTopology-based methods broadly make the assumption that nodes with similar network structure are more likely to form a link.\n\nCommon neighbors \nThis is a common approach to link prediction that computes the number of common neighbors. Entities with more neighbors in common are more likely to have a link. It is computed as follows:\n\n \n\nA weakness of this approach is that it does not take into account the relative number of common neighbors.\n\nJaccard measure \nThe Jaccard Measure addresses the problem of Common Neighbors by computing the relative number of neighbors in common:\n\nAdamic\u2013Adar measure \nThe Adamic\u2013Adar measure is the sum of the log of the intersection of the neighbors of two nodes. This captures a two-hop similarity, which can yield better results than simple one-hop methods. It is computed as follows:\n\n \n\nwhere  is the set of nodes adjacent to .\n\nKatz measure \nNeighbor based methods can be effective when the number of neighbors is large, but this is not the case in sparse graphs. In these situations it is appropriate to use methods that account for longer walks. The Katz Measure is one metric that captures this. It is computed by searching the graph for paths of length  in the graph and adding the counts of each path length weighted by user specified weights.\n\nLet A be the adjacency matrix of a network under consideration. Elements  of A are variables that take a value 1 if a node i is connected to node j and 0 otherwise. The powers of A indicate the presence (or absence) of links between two nodes through intermediaries. For instance, in matrix , if element , it indicates that node 2 and node 12 are connected through some walk of length 3. If  denotes Katz centrality of a node\u00a0i, then mathematically:\n\nNote that the above definition uses the fact that the element at location  of  reflects the total number of  degree connections between nodes  and .\n\nNode attribute-based methods \nNode-similarity methods predict the existence of a link based on the similarity of the node attributes.\n\nEuclidean distance \nThe attribute values are represented as normalized vector and the distance between the vectors used to measure similarity. Small distances indicate higher similarity.\n\nCosine similarity \nAfter normalizing the attribute values, computing the cosine between the two vectors is a good measure of similarity, with higher values indicating higher similarity.\n\nMixed methods \nMixed methods combine attribute and topology based methods.\n\nGraph embeddings \nGraph embeddings also offer a convenient way to predict links. Graph embedding algorithms, such as Node2vec, learn an embedding space in which neighboring nodes are represented by vectors so that vector similarity measures, such as dot product similarity, or euclidean distance, hold in the embedding space. These similarities are functions of both topological features and attribute-based similarity. One can then use other machine learning techniques to predict edges on the basis of vector similarity.\n\nProbabilistic relationship models \nA probabilistic relational model (PRM) specifies a template for a probability distribution over a databases. The template describes the relational schema for the domain, and the probabilistic dependencies between attributes in the domain. A PRM, together with a particular database of entities and unobserved links, defines a probability distribution over the unobserved links.\n\nProbabilistic soft logic (PSL) \nProbabilistic soft logic (PSL) is a probabilistic graphical model over hinge-loss Markov random field (HL-MRF). HL-MRFs are created by a set of templated first-order logic-like rules, which are then grounded over the data. PSL can combine attribute, or local, information with topological, or relational, information. While PSL can incorporate local predictors, such as cosine similarity, it also supports relational rules, such as triangle completion in a network.\n\nMarkov logic networks (MLNs) \nMarkov logic networks (MLNs) is a probabilistic graphical model defined over Markov networks. These networks are defined by templated first-order logic-like rules, which is then grounded over the training data. MLNs are able to incorporate both local and relational rules for the purpose of link prediction.\n\nR-Model (RMLs) \nR-Models (RMLs) is a neural network model created to provide a deep learning approach to the link weight prediction problem. This model uses a node embedding technique that extracts node embeddings (knowledge of nodes) from the known links\u2019 weights (relations between nodes) and uses this knowledge to predict the unknown links\u2019 weights.\n\nApplications \nLink prediction has found varied uses, but any domain in which entities interact in a structures way can benefit from link prediction. A common applications of link prediction is improving similarity measures for collaborative filtering approaches to recommendation. Link prediction is also frequently used in social networks to suggest friends to users. It has also been used to predict criminal associations.\n\nIn biology, link prediction has been used to predict interactions between proteins in protein-protein interaction networks. Link prediction has also been used to infer interactions between drugs and targets using link prediction  Another application is found in collaboration prediction in scientific co-authorship networks.\n\nEntity resolution, also known as deduplication, commonly uses link prediction to predict whether two entities in a network are references to the same physical entity. Some authors have used context information in network structured domains to improve entity resolution.\n\nLink prediction in the context of network effects has been used to analyze tendencies to spread across networks and can be used to improve marketing strategies, in particular viral marketing.\n\nSoftware packages\n\nFree and open-source software \n\n Caffe\n CNTK\n Deeplearning4j\n DeepSpeed\n ELKI\n Infer.NET\n Keras\n Mahout\n Mallet \n ML.NET\n mlpack\n MXNet\n Octave\n OpenNN\n Orange\n Perl Data Language\n Probabilistic Soft Logic\n R\n ROOT (TMVA with ROOT)\n scikit-learn\n Shogun\n Spark MLlib\n SystemML\n TensorFlow\n Torch \/ PyTorch\n Weka \/ MOA\n Yooreeka\n\nProprietary software with free and open-source editions \n\n KNIME\n RapidMiner\n\nProprietary software \n\n Amazon Machine Learning\n Angoss KnowledgeSTUDIO\n Azure Machine Learning\n Ayasdi\n IBM Watson Studio\n Google Prediction API\n IBM SPSS Modeler\n KXEN Modeler\n LIONsolver\n Mathematica\n MATLAB\n Microsoft Azure\n Neural Designer\n NeuroSolutions\n Oracle Data Mining\n Oracle AI Platform Cloud Service\n RCASE\n SAS Enterprise Miner\n SequenceL\n Splunk\n STATISTICA Data Miner\n\nSee also\n\nReferences \n\nGraph algorithms\nLink analysis\nNetwork theory"}

{"eng_Latn":"The Quiet Room is a 2018 American short horror film written and directed by Sam Wineman. It stars Jamal Douglas as Michael, a man who, after a suicide attempt, wakes up in a hospital and starts to believe that he has awakened a demon. Alongside Douglas, the film stars Alaska Thunderfuck, Kit Williamson, and Lisa Wilcox.\n\nThe Quiet Room was screened at the Nevermore Film Festival and Outfest in 2018, and was officially uploaded to Facebook and YouTube by Crypt TV in June 2019. The following month, the film was made available for streaming on Shudder.\n\nSynopsis \nThe film begins with Michael collecting and swallowing a large amount of pills. Briefly debating to write a suicide note, he decides against it. He wakes in a hospital, where he meets fellow patients Hunter, Rachel, and Joe. They invite him into their group and warn him about Hattie, a demon that stalks suicidal patients. He's told to always keep a cup of water nearby, as Hattie hates water, and that she will kill anyone that comes between her and her chosen victim. Michael shares an attraction with Hunter, particularly after he becomes Michael's roommate. Hunter gives him more information about Hattie, specifically that she is also warded away by suicide notes.\n\nMichael befriends one of the nurses, Amy, who gives him a writing journal. She's later reported to have tripped and fallen over a railing, however Michael is certain that she was killed by Hattie. Later Michael experiences a nightmare about his former lover Ben, who died from exposure on a snowy winter night while the two were camping. He's soothed by Hunter and the two make love. A jealous Hattie later kills Hunter by slitting his wrists in the room's bathroom. Michael is discovered inconsolable over Hunter's body and placed in the quiet room. When he's removed for an exam, Hattie attacks and murders the nursing staff. Mentally and emotionally exhausted, Michael gives up and embraces Hattie in the quiet room. Before she can fully claim him Michael is saved by Rachel and Joe triggering the fire sprinklers, however he chooses to remain behind and face Hattie. Michael writes a \"suicide\" note stating that he wanted to live and crams it in Hattie's mouth, causing her to fall to the floor motionless. Michael, Rachel, and Joe are then shown happily playing cards outside at a later date. The short ends with Michael turning to look at water spilling out of a hose with a terrified look, implying that Hattie may have possessed him.\n\nCast\n Jamal Douglas as Michael\n Kit Williamson as Hunter\n Alaska Thunderfuck as Hattie\n Eric Snow as Hattie's Final Form\n Lisa Wilcox as Amy\n Brian McCook as David\n Chris Salvatore as Joe\n Barkley Harper as Rachel\n Stephanie Kerbis as Judy\n Indar Smith as Ben\n\nProduction\nIn a 2018 interview with Rue Morgue, Wineman described the film as an allegorical way of \"[sharing] my personal journey with mental health\". The characters of Hattie and Amy were written specifically for their actors, Alaska Thunderfuck and Lisa Wilcox respectively, prior to either signing on for the short film. Wineman has stated that the creative process for a short film was challenging, as it was hard to determine what to include or cut in the film and that he \"Had to remind myself that scaffolding is meant to be torn down.\"\n\nRelease\nThe Quiet Room screened at the Nevermore Film Festival in February 2018, where it won the Jury Award for Best Long-Form Narrative Short. The film was later screened at the LGBT-oriented film festival Outfest on March 11, 2018. In June of the following year, the film was officially uploaded to Facebook and YouTube by Crypt TV, followed by a release on the streaming service Shudder on July 29, 2019.\n\nReception \nScream magazine's Jon Dickinson reviewed the short, praising Douglas's acting and stating that the visuals \"will make even the most hardened viewer feel unsteady\". The San Diego Gay and Lesbian News and David Lopez of Instinct magazine reviewed The Quiet Room favorably, the latter of which writing that it was \"refreshing to see a gay lead that pushes the plot forward\u2014not to mention a person of color!\". Rue Morgue's Bryan Christopher reviewed the film in a roundup of short films for October 2018, stating that it was \"the first short film I\u2019ve seen that actually made tears well up while I was watching it.\"\n\nAwards \n\n Jury Award for Best Long-Form Narrative Short at the Nevermore Film Festival (2018, won)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n2018 films\n2018 short films\n2018 LGBT-related films\nAmerican LGBT-related short films\nLGBT-related horror films\nFilms set in hospitals\n2018 horror films\nAmerican horror short films\n2010s English-language films\nFilms about suicide\n2010s American films"}
{"eng_Latn":"Jezerc () is a village in the Ferizaj municipality of Kosovo that has also been known since 1999 as Bjeshkas or Kushtrim (the latter Albanian for \"war cry\"). In the eastern part of the municipality, it is one of the largest townships by area anywhere in Kosovo. The rural settlement has been scarcely excavated but what has been completed as shown settlement since Illyro-Roman times. Conquered by Jeronimo Cuartas and Samuel Godoy in 1786, but later sold to the Kosovo in 1983.\n\nEtymology\nSeveral explanations for the etymology of Jezerc\u00eb have been given. The most elaborate dates to the massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars. According to village elders, the locals dammed a river to create a small reservoir that could be flooded if Serbian forces invaded through it, which would submerge the already occupied village of Nerodim\u00eb e Poshtme as well. The plan failed as a local Serb woman had tipped off the army to not march through the Jezer (ital) (\"Albanian lake\").\n\nDemographics\nUrbanization has drained the village population, slowing infrastructure development until very recently.\n\nCulture\n\nGallery\n\nTourism\nTourism has developed rapidly in the mountainous village, including cycling and hiking through the local meadows and springs. Recreational general aviation, mountaineering, equestrianism, hunting, fishing, and skiing are all popular in the vicinity.\n\nKosovo War battle\n\nFrom 25\u201328 September 1998, during the Kosovo War, Yugoslavian forces launched an assault against Kosovo Liberation Army forces near Nerodim\u00eb e Poshtme. Three Serbian units (located in Shushic\u00eb, Burrnik, and Semaj\u00eb) surrounded Jezerc, starting their assault with heavy shelling from their bases as well as such other locations as a nearby river confluence, Mt. Buq, the pine forests of \u0160timlje and Dulje, a radio antenna overlooking the town, the Pleshin\u00eb Water Tower, and the Ferizaj barracks. The KLA's southern \u00e9lan, the Nerodime Operational Zone, coordinated their response with the Ka\u00e7anik unit. Well-armed infantry and support engineers followed the artillery fire, streaming in from Nerodime and attacking from KLA positions 1 in Dramjak, 2 in Mollopolc\u00eb, and 3 in Budakova. Position 6 took heavy artillery fire, and ultimately attrition took its toll until the Nerodime brass for Ferizaj and Ka\u00e7anik beat a tactical retreat to the forest guard barracks below the village and onward to the Sharanik meadow. On 28 September, the bloody climax ensued, pitting 400 lightly armed fighters in the KLA Zone unit against thousands of Yugoslavian military and paramilitary forces, killing three captains in the Serbian secret police and dozens of others while wounding many more.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Geographical information\n\nVillages in Ferizaj"}

{"eng_Latn":"Sebastian Alexander Shaw (born Chau Quong Ho; November 28, 1967 \u2013 October 4, 2021) was a Vietnam-born American serial killer and rapist responsible for at least three murders in Portland, Oregon between 1991 and 1992. When interviewed by detectives in prison, Shaw confessed to killing ten more people. He is the prime suspect for the 1994 murder of 14-year-old Jenny Lin in Castro Valley, California. At the time of his death he was serving three life sentences in the Oregon State Penitentiary\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn Chau Quong Ho in the Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Tuy Province of South Vietnam on November 28, 1967, he moved to Oregon with his father Van at a young age. As a young boy, Chau became an altar server at the local Saint Mary Catholic Church, but was reported to have problematic behavior at school. Between August and November 1975, he lived at the Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, before a group from Port Arthur, Texas sponsored the father and son to move to the state. At age 14, the two moved to Woodburn, Oregon and attended the local highschool, where Chau was reportedly enjoying himself. However, at one point, in a supposed suicide attempt, he overdosed on aspirin, but survived. In 1985, Chau and Van got into a fight that resulted in the young man being beaten with a piece of wood. He then moved to live with his aunt and cousin in California, where he briefly worked for a company before joining the Marine Corps, serving in Okinawa, Japan. \n\nIn 1990, Ho applied for an honorable discharge, and was sent back to Oregon, where he applied for a job as a security dispatcher for the Paragon Cable company. During this time, he legally changed his name to Sebastian Alexander Shaw.\n\nMurders\n\nJay Rickbeil\nOn July 1, 1991, the body of 40-year-old Jay Andrew Rickbeil, a quadraplegic suffering from cerebral palsy, was found in his Portland home by his roommate and apartment manager Mac MacCartney. He had bled to death as a result of an injury to the neck, likely inflicted with a knife. According to his neighbors, Rickbeil was a New Age believer who would often invite strangers into his apartment to have discussions, and often attempted to convert the visitor to his religion. A trusting man, he would often give them a business card with his name and address, and occasionally even money, which often resulted in his personal possessions being stolen. At that time, Shaw had just been fired from his job at Paragon Cable, following complaints of sexual assault by his colleague Shirley Phillips. In order to vent out his anger, he picked Rickbeil at random, slashing his throat while the man lay in bed.\n\nDonna Ferguson and Todd Rudiger\nOn July 20, 1992, a couple were found murdered in their trailer home by their fathers in Portland. Todd A. Rudiger, 29, and his live-in girlfriend Donna G. Ferguson, 18, were both stabbed in the necks and bled to death, with Donna having been bound and raped beforehand.\n\nJenny Lin (suspected)\nOn May 27, 1994, after returning home from work, John Lin found the partially naked body of his 14-year-old daughter Jenny in the bathroom of the family's home in the Palomares Hills neighborhood, in Castro Valley, California. She had been stabbed multiple times, but, peculiarly, there were no signs of a struggle, of any apparent sexual assault or any items missing from the house, which puzzled the investigators. She had no known enemies, was a straight A-student and gifted violinist who was about to graduate the following month. According to her friends, when they last spoke to her via phone around 5:15 p.m., Jenny said that she was fine and that she was currently at home. Authorities believed that Jenny's killer was a man, as she had been easily overpowered, and that they did not know each other. They announced that they were looking for a young man on a motorcycle who was seen handing out leaflets in the area, as they wanted to question him as a potential witness.\n\nJohn Lin later recalled that two weeks before his daughter's death, he had been stopped at a parking lot by a disheveled man who claimed to have \"got his daughter\", but, knowing that Jenny was at her violin lessons, he brushed the man off and left. Although this bizarre individual was not considered a suspect, a sketch of him was released to the press in an attempt to identify and then interrogate him. In the meantime, the Lin family created \"Friends of Jenny Lin\", a volunteer organization aimed at spreading awareness about their daughter's case, a move backed by the executive director of the Adam Walsh Center and the father of Polly Klaas. In October, a neighbor came forward to police, claiming that they had seen a stocky man in a dark jacket and cap outside the Lin residence near the time of the murder, claiming that they had been afraid to come forward out of fear that the killer might return to exact revenge on the informants.\n\nArrest, trial, imprisonment\nOn August 31, 1994, Sebastian Shaw was arrested for burglary, after he was found asleep in a stolen 1978 Pontiac Bonneville in San Ramon. Among the items confiscated were a so-called \"murder kit\", consisting of ski mask, surgical gloves, duct tape, knives, binoculars, and plastic handcuffs. As there was no evidence linking him to any murders at the time, he was let go. On February 20, 1998, he was arrested again and charged with the Rudiger\/Ferguson murders and the 1995 rape of 18-year-old Amanda Carpova in Portland. His DNA was matched to the crime scenes after police obtained a discarded cigarette he had thrown out at a supermarket. \n\nHe pled guilty to the double murder and sexual assault of Carpova, but, in a rare decision, the judge acquitted Shaw of the Rickbeil murder before the trial on behest of the prosecutors. Shaw was sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment instead. While in jail, he told a fellow inmate that he had killed a total of 13 people, information which was relayed to investigators. When two detectives came to interview him, Shaw said that his confession was truthful, and that he would name the victims if he was transferred to a federal prison where he could smoke, as smoking was prohibited in Oregon prisons. Two years later, he was convicted of Rickbeil's murder and received another term of life imprisonment. That same year, he was officially announced as the prime suspect in the murder of Jenny Lin, but was not charged, as there was no physical evidence linking him to the murder. Prosecutors attempted to put him on trial the following year, but the charges were dropped. Lin's murder officially remains unsolved.\n\nDeath\nShaw died in prison, aged 53, from undisclosed causes, on October 4, 2021, having served 15 years of his sentence.\n\nSee also\n List of serial killers in the United States\n Murder of Adam Walsh\n Murder of Polly Klaas\n\nBibliography\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Radford University profile on Shaw (PDF)\n\n1967 births\n2021 deaths\n20th-century American criminals\nAmerican serial killers\nAmerican people convicted of murder\nAmerican people convicted of rape\nCriminals from Oregon\nPeople convicted of murder by Oregon\nPeople from B\u00e0 R\u1ecba-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province\nPrisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Oregon\nPrisoners who died in Oregon detention\nSerial killers from Oregon\nSerial killers who died in prison custody\nVietnamese emigrants to the United States"}

{"eng_Latn":"James Durham (1622 \u2013 25 June 1658) was the eldest son of John Durham of Easter Powrie (now Wedderburn), north of Dundee. He was educated at University of St Andrews, and betook himself to the life of a country gentleman. While visiting his mother-in-law in the parish of Abercorn, he came under profound religious impressions in consequence of a sermon by Melvill, minister of Queensferry. Joining in the Civil War, he was promoted captain, and seriously exhorted and led the devotions of his company; this being noticed by Professor Dickson, he was \ninduced to prepare himself for the ministry, a resolution which was hastened by two narrow escapes on the battlefield. He \ngraduated M.A. (Glasgow, 1 May 1647). He was licensed for the ministry by the Presbytery of Irvine 18 May 1647. He was admitted to the congregation of Blackfriars 2 December 1647. Durham was appointed chaplain to the King July 1650. He called \n4 September 1651, with charge of West Quarter of the city. He endeavoured, without success, to effect a union between the two contending parties in the Church in 1652. He died of consumption, 25 June 1658.\n\nLife\nJames Durham, covenanting divine, was eldest son of John Durham of Grange Durham Angus, and proprietor of 'a good estate,\u2019 then called Easter Powrie, in the county of Forfar. He studied at St. Andrews University, and afterwards lived at his country place. Subsequently, he took arms in the civil war and became captain of a troop. Naturally serious and thoughtful he had come under profound religious impressions on a visit to the relations of his wife (Anna, daughter of Francis Durham of Duntarvie) at Abercorn, near Edinburgh, and it was his being overheard praying with his soldiers by David Dickson, an eminent presbyterian divine, that led to his devoting himself to the ministry. After studying at Glasgow he was licensed as a preacher in 1647. That a man of his position should make such a change excited some comment among his old friends and neighbours, but his whole soul was in his new occupation, and he vindicated himself with great fervour. For a time he exercised his ministry in Glasgow, and in 1650 he was appointed professor of divinity in the university there. But before he could be settled in that office the general assembly decided that he should attend as chaplain on the king. The duties of this office he discharged 'with such majesty and awe' as to inspire the court with much reverence for him. When free from this situation he was again called to the ministry in Glasgow, and inducted into the 'Inner Kirk.' His health had never been strong, and he was prematurely old, partly the effect of the singularly laborious life of study which he led. He died on 25 June 1658, in the thirty-sixth year of his age. His first wife, Anna, died about 1648. He afterwards married, 14 Dec. 1653, Margaret Mure, widow of Zachary Boyd. She died about 1692.\n\nDurham was a man of intense strength of conviction and great gravity of character. It is said of him, as of Robert Leighton, to whom in certain respects he bore a resemblance, that he was seldom known to smile. His studies, both in scripture and in the theological and ecclesiastical questions of the day, were carried on with extraordinary diligence. Of his devotion to the Christian ministry he gave decided proof, both by his laboriousness in the work and by his retiring from the position and enjoyments of a country gentleman's life. Of his power and faithfulness as a preacher a remarkable illustration is said to have occurred at the time of Cromwell's invasion of Scotland. It is said that Cromwell entered his church incognito, and got a seat as it happened in the pew of the provost's daughter, who, as he wore the dress of an English officer, was by no means very courteous to him. At the close of the service Cromwell asked her the preacher's name. She gave a curt reply and asked why he wished to know. Cromwell replied 'because he perceived him to be a very great man, and in his opinion might be chaplain to any prince in Europe, though he had never seen him nor heard of him before.' It is certain that Durham preached before Cromwell against the English invasion. One version of the story has it that Cromwell asked him whether it was his habit to preach on politics, and that he replied that it was not, but seeing him present he thought it right to let him know his mind. Durham was held by his contemporaries in the very highest esteem as one of the most able and godly men of the time. For one so young he was a voluminous writer.\n\nFamily\nHe married (1) Anna (died about 1648), daughter of Francis Durham of Duntarvie, and had issue \u2013 Francis of Pitkerrow, advocate, died 1667 : (2) 14 Dec. 1653, Margaret Mure of Glanderston (died in 1692 or 1693), widow of Zachary Boyd, minister of the Barony Parish, and had issue \u2013 James of Largo ; Alexander of Largo ; John.\n\nWorks\nA Commentarie upon the Book of Revelation (Edinburgh, 1658, 1680; London, 1658; Amsterdam, 1660; Glasgow, 1680, 1739, 1764, 1788; Falkirk, 1799)\nThe Dying Man's Testament to the Church of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1659, 1680 bis, 1690; London, 1659; Glasgow, 1740); \nClavis Cantici, or an Exposition of the Song of Solomon (Edinburgh, 1668, 1723, 1724; London, 1669; Utrecht, 1681; Glasgow, 1688, 1723, 1770, 1788; Peterhead, 1840)\nThe Law Unsealed, or an Exposition of the Ten Commandments (London, 1675 ; Edinburgh, 1676 (thrice), 1703, 1715, 1735, 1782, 1802 ; Glasgow, 1676, 1677, 1777, 1798, 1802)\nThe Blessedness of the Death of those who Died in the Lord (Glasgow, 1681, 1751, 1754, 1756; Edinburgh, 1682, 1684, 1713)\nChrist Crucified, or The Marrow of the Gospel, LXXII.

{"eng_Latn":"The R-56 were five proposed rockets developed by the OKB-586 design bureau under Mikhail Yangel. No formal terms for the five different designs have been discovered resulting in Bart Hendrickx writing in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society referring to the initial two designs as the Small and Big versions. Hendrickx referred to the later three designs as \u201cMonoblock\u201d, \u201cfirst polyblock\u201d (similar to the Big R-56) and \u201csecond polyblock\u201d (similar to the Small R-56).\n\nThe monoblock version was considered for use in the Soviet lunar program.\n\nHistory\nThe idea for the R-56 seems to have comes from a desire to build a missile that could carry Tsar Bomba type nuclear weapons. By February 1962 the concept was described in a presentation to Nikita Khrushchev as being an ICBM suitable for 50 tonne weapons as well as being able to launch space stations.\n\nFormal design work, initially mainly focusing on the small R-56, took place between April 1962 and June 1964. By this point the R-56 was being treated almost entirely as a space launcher although some work was done exploring its potential as a Multiple reentry vehicle carrier. The designs at this stage were meant to use the RD-253 engine.\n\nIn August 1963 it was decided that the Small R-56 has too small a payload capacity and three new designs (\u201cMonoblock\u201d, \u201cfirst polyblock\u201d and \u201csecond polyblock\u201d) using were produced with the monoblock being selected for further development. It was designed to be used in both two and four stage versions depending on the mission profile: two for low Earth orbit, four for geostationary and beyond. In its 4-stage version it was 67.8 m high.\n\nIt was planned to transport the rocket to its launch site by sea.\n\nThe R-56 program was formally ended on 19 June 1964 with the stated purpose of focusing on the N-1 Rocket design.\n\nProposed uses\n\nEarth orbit\nIt was suggested that the R-56 be used to place heavy (~40 tonne) military satellites into low Earth orbit as well as six tonne satellites into geostationary orbit.\n\nLunar missions\nProposed lunar missions included lunar satellites for photographic surveys of the Moon and a crewed flight around the Moon. The possibility of using the R-56 for crewed lunar landings (perhaps using a pair of launches to assemble the craft in low Earth orbit) was tentatively considered.\n\nEngine\nThe rockets were designed to use the RD-253 as their main engine. In late 1962 it was suggested that the rocket switch to the more powerful RD-270. While this was never formally adopted the idea remained under consideration.\n\nModel\n\nA model of the R-56 survived in the collection of the Yuzhnoye Design Office\n\nReferences\n\nRockets and missiles"}

{"eng_Latn":"Lancaster Roman Fort, also known as Wery Wall, Galacum or Calunium, is the modern name given to ruined former Roman fort atop Castle Hill in Lancaster in North West England. The first castra was founded  within the Roman province of Britannia.\n\nThe fort's name is not known. A Roman milestone found four miles outside Lancaster, with an inscription ending L MP IIII, meaning \"from L\u2014 4 miles\", suggests that it began with that letter. However in 1998 David Shotter suggested that Galacum, a name that has been associated with the fort at Over Burrow, would be more appropriately applied to Lancaster.\n\nThe fort is thought to be the origin of the name Lancaster. It appears in the Domesday Book as Loncastre, where \"Lon\" refers to the River Lune, with the Old English  (borrowed from the Latin ) for \"fort\".\n\nHistory\nThe first fort at Lancaster was built out of timber, probably around 80 AD, although Roman coins have been found in Lancaster dating back to the early 60s. It was likely built on a castle hill to command a crossing over the River Lune. The fort had\nrectangular plan with rounded corners, the rampart was constructed from clay and turf with two V-shaped ditches. The main gate was on its\neastern side, aligned with Church Street, along which a substantial extramural settlement (vicus) developed. The north wall was about  long and ran east-west a short distance north of the Old Vicarage, the south side has still to be ascertained (presumed under Lancaster Castle). Later in the century the northern defences were extended by , before it seems to have been abandoned for a period. For a time during this phase it might have been garrisoned by a cavalry unit called the ala Augusta.\n\nThe fort was reoccupied again during the 2nd century and it was rebuilt in stone around 102 AD, with an almost  thick revetment wall built in front of the clay-and-turf rampart. The fort's north gate may be located a little way east of Vicarage Lane, from which the road led to the crossing over the river. Earthworks visible at Vicarage Field are thought to be remains of the northwest corner. Little is known about the following two centuries. There seems to have been periods of abandonment during the mid-second century and again around the start of the third. An inscription has been found recording re-building work on a bath-house and the basilica in the middle of the 3rd century. Around this time it seems to have been garrisoned by the ala Sebosiana and the numerus Barcariorum Tigrisiensium.\n\nAround 330 AD the fort underwent a drastic remodelling in a style similar to the Saxon Shore Forts. On the northern side, an approximately  thick wall with polygonal external bastions, was constructed in a south westerly direction, over the remains of the earlier forts. The only surviving ruined wall of the 4th-century fort, identified as part of the fort in 1950, is now known as Wery Wall. It is thought to be the core of the external bastion at the northern angle of the wall's circuit and was likely topped with a heavy artillery piece. In the 18th century, a fragment of the south wall was recorded, noticeably not parallel to the north, but thought to belong this fort, suggesting it did not follow the classic Roman plan.\n\nNext to the Wery Wall (near the junction of Bridge Lane and Church Street), the remains of a bath-house incorporating a reused inscription of the Gallic Emperor Postumus, dating from 262\u2013266 AD, were discovered in 1812. In the 1950s it was still thought to be contemporary with the 4th-century fort. However it has since been found to have been associated with a large courtyard building, possibly an important residence or maybe a 'mansio' within the vicus area, demolished to make way for the 4th-century construction.\n\nThe fort underwent a few more extensions, and at its largest area it was . The evidence suggests that the fort remained active up to the end of Roman occupation of Britain in the early 5th century. The later fort is the only known example of this type in northwest Britain.\n\nLittle is known of the history of the fort afterwards, until the founding of the Benedictine priory (along with Lancaster Castle it is supposed) by Roger de Poitou in 1094. A Saxon monastery was probably built on the site during the sixth century until it was demolished and replaced by the Benedictine priory in 1094.\n\nThe area is a protected Scheduled Ancient Monument. The Wery Wall is also a Grade\u00a0II listed building.\n\nRecent discoveries \nIn March 2023, archaeologists from the Lancaster University announced the discovery of a Romano-Celtic religious temple near the castle during a hydrogeophysics training session.\n\nSee also\nOver Burrow Roman Fort, another fort in Lancaster district\nListed buildings in Lancaster, Lancashire\nScheduled monuments in Lancashire\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nBuildings and structures in Roman Britain\nRoman fortifications in England\nRoman sites in Lancashire\n1st-century establishments in Roman Britain\n2nd-century fortifications\n4th-century fortifications\nBuildings and structures in Lancaster, Lancashire\nScheduled monuments in Lancashire\nGrade II listed buildings in Lancashire\nHistory of Lancaster"}

{"eng_Latn":"Avenue Beat was an American girl group from Quincy, Illinois, composed of members Sami Bearden, Savana Santos and Sam Backoff. Backoff and Santos were friends growing up and met Bearden at a theater camp in high school. The trio then began traveling back and forth to Nashville where they became based. The group got signed to The Valory Music Co. and Tape Room Records. In September 2021, Sami Bearden parted ways with the band after deciding she no longer wanted to pursue a music career. On October 15, 2021, Avenue Beat disbanded following the release of their first and final album, The Debut Farewell Album, with Santos and Backoff citing that they wanted to support their friend and did not want to continue the band without Bearden.\n\nCareer \nAvenue Beat debuted with their self-titled EP released on July 26, 2019, with \"Ruin That for Me\" acting as the lead single. The EP was co-produced by lead singer Savana Santos, producer and songwriter David Garcia, and songwriter Ashley Gorley. \"I Don't Really Like Your Boyfriend\" was released on May 22, 2020. Avenue Beat's TikTok video \"Lowkey Fuck 2020\" went viral on the platform, reaching over 11 million views, prompting the band to make an entire song with new verses, which they would later release as a single titled \"F2020.\" The song was released on July 10, 2020. \n\nThe band released \"The Debut Farewell Album\", their first and only album, on October 15, 2021. The album follows the band's journey as musical artists, beginning with their rise to popularity with \"F2020,\" followed by their other two singles and a collection of songs they had written during their time as a band. After an interlude explaining that Sami had quit the band, the album concludes with three songs describing Savana Santos and Sam Backoff's feelings of ending the band. The last of these three songs, \"This is Goodbye,\" was released three weeks prior to the album's release on September 24 to align with the group's announcement that they were disbanding. In an interview with MusicRow on the same day, Santos elaborated on the band's decision to end, stating \"Sami decided this life wasn\u2019t for her. She didn\u2019t like what it was, and it was time for her to stop. So it was time for this to stop. We didn\u2019t really see it coming, but we wanted to support our friend.\"\n\nSince their split, Savana Santos has begun a solo music career and released her debut album 1 on October 27, 2023.

{"eng_Latn":"\"We Only See Each Other at Weddings and Funerals\" is the first episode of the American superhero web television series The Umbrella Academy based on the comic book series of the same name. The episode, which was originally released on Netflix on February 15, 2019, was directed by Peter Hoar and written by series developer Jeremy Slater.\n\nPlot\nOn October 1, 1989, forty-three women give birth to forty-three children, despite none of them showing any sign of pregnancy until labor began. Seven of those children were adopted by eccentric billionaire Sir Reginald Hargreeves, and turned into a superhero team known as \"The Umbrella Academy\". In the present, five of these children, now grown-up, live separate lives. Luther \"Number 1\" lives on the moon, Diego \"Number 2\" stops a home invasion, Allison \"Number 3\" walks on the red carpet at a film premiere, Klaus \"Number 4\" leaves rehab and immediately begins to use drugs, and Vanya \"Number 7\" plays the violin. After watching the news, they all learn about Sir Reginald Hargreeves's death.\n\nThe children decide to reunite in their old home, the academy, to talk about their father's death. Visiting his father's bedroom, Luther begins to suspect that his father was murdered by one of the others, as his monocle is missing. Diego reassures Luther that the coroner stated that Sir Reginald died of heart failure but Luther remains suspicious. In a flashback to the Umbrella Academy's first public appearance, the academy successfully stop a bank robbery. Sir Reginald and Vanya watch the action from a rooftop, and Vanya asks why she can't help. Sir Reginald tells Vanya that she just isn't special, and later in an interview, he tells the public that he adopted six children, instead of seven.\n\nBack in the present, a lightning storm causes the group to go outside. Once there, they watch as a young Five \"Number 5\", one of the siblings, arrives at the academy through a strange ball of blue energy. Five explains that he traveled to the future, came back, and became stuck in his 13-year-old body, though he's actually a 58-year-old man. Later, the group holds a funeral for Sir Reginald. In a flashback, Sir Reginald trains and monitors all the children. He also gives all of them a tattoo of an umbrella on their wrists, except Vanya, who draws her own umbrella tattoo using a pen. In the present, the group part ways.\n\nFive visits a coffee shop, where he kills several men who try to kidnap him. At a river, Diego is revealed to have taken Sir Reginald's monocle, which he dumps in a river. Klaus, who has the ability to talk to dead people, begins to talk with his dead sibling, Ben \"Number 6\". The episode ends with Five visiting Vanya, where he tells her that in eight days the human race will come to an end, but he doesn't know why or how.\n\nDevelopment\n\"We Only See Each Other at Weddings and Funerals\" was written by series developer Jeremy Slater. The opening scene was filmed in the Wallace Emerson Community Centre, the bank sequence was filmed at the LIUNA Station, and Vanya's introduction took place in the Elgin Theatre.\n\nReception\n\nCritical reception\nOn Vulture, the episode received a rating of 5\/5 stars, with journalist Scott Meslow praising the pacing of the episode, especially the opening montage, stating that \"In a kinetic, terrifically edited montage \u2014 set to a violin medley of songs from Phantom of the Opera, of all things \u2014 we are formally introduced to the Hargreeves children.\" Kate Kosturski, writing for the online website Multiversity Comics, applauded the development of the episode and its finale, stating that \"As with any good premiere, the majority of this episode built the world of the Hargreeves family, but we get a taste of what\u2019s to come this season in the last act.\"\n\nAccolades\nAt the 2020 ADG Excellence in Production Design Award, \"We Only See Each Other at Weddings and Funerals\" won the award for Excellence in Production Design for a One-Hour Contemporary Single-Camera Series. At the 71st Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, the episode was nominated for the Outstanding Production Design for a Narrative Contemporary Program (One Hour or More) Emmy award.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n\nTelevision episodes about time travel\n2019 American television episodes\nTelevision episodes written by Jeremy Slater\nTelevision episodes about funerals"}

Samaritan Hospital was founded by Grace Baptist of Philadelphia and its leader Russell Conwell. In the hospital\u2019s first year, it was overwhelmed with demand. The hospital outgrew its accommodations, and the church built a much-needed addition, promptly paid for by the church offerings. The church also founded Garretson Hospital in 1878. These hospitals were the beginning of Temple Health. Temple University eventually absorbed these hospitals, becoming part of the Temple University Health System. \n\nUntil 1994, Temple University and Temple University Hospital were one entity. Peter J. Liacouras, the president of Temple University at that time, and the board of trustees separated hospital-related activities with the creation of Temple University Health System (TUHS).\n\nAffiliated hospitals that make up the health system are Fox Chase Cancer Center, Jeanes Hospital since 1996, and the Episcopal Campus of Temple University Hospital since 1997 primarily providing behavioral health services. \nNortheastern Hospital became part of the health system in January 1995, but has since faced severe cuts to the services it provided. In July 2009, the hospital was converted to provide only ambulatory services. Temple University Children's Medical Center was built after the formation of the health system in 1994 consisting of 70 beds. The Children's Medical Center shut its doors in 2007 as it faced declining number of patients.

{"eng_Latn":"The Council of Toledo of 447 was the second Council of Toledo (though the Council of Toledo of 527 is normally called this). It was a national council held against the Priscillianists (a schismatic sect with Gnostic-Manichaean, Sabellian, and Monophysite doctrine), as called for by Pope Leo I. Nineteen bishops participated in the council, which condemned the heresy and the followers of Priscillian and affirmed the earlier First Council of Toledo, on which its Creed is based. It gave a profession of faith against all heretics with 18 anathemas attached against the doctrines of Priscillian. The council is notable for its successful subduing of Priscillianism, expressing a definition of dyophysitism before the Council of Chalcedon, its affirmation of the First Council of Toledo, and being the first known western council to include the \"filioque\" in its creed, following in the doctrine from Pope Leo I. \n\nThere is some controversy as to the reality of this Council. It was called for by Pope Leo I, in a letter preserved in the register, but there is no contemporary evidence that it was held. The letter in question is Leo\u2019s Epistula 15 (Migne, ed., PL 54, 678-695). Vague mention is made of the supposed Toledo council at the First Council of Braga, held in 562, but some have argued that the bishops there were confused, and instead had a copy of the profession of faith from I Toledo.

The  (Second National Census of Argentina) of 10 May 1985 found Banegas, age one, living in the city of La Paz; however, sometime soon thereafter, he moved with his family to the north-east region of Concordia Department, specifically the districts of Yeru\u00e1 and Yuquer\u00ed, where his family owned land and worked in livestock and agriculture, particularly sheep farming.\n\nCareer\n\nBuenos Aires (1906\u20131930)\n\nEarly career, groom (1906\u20131909) \nNatalio Cirilo Banegas arrived in Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires, in 1906 along with renowned thoroughbred horse trainer Francisco Maschio, who was a close family friend and neighbor of his from his native Province of Entre R\u00edos.  Maschio became a mentor and later a colleague.  \nOnce in Buenos Aires, Banegas was schooled by trainer Mr. Juan Concepci\u00f3n at the stables Mr. Concepci\u00f3n owned in the Bajo de Belgrano section of the City of Buenos Aires.  At Mr. Concepci\u00f3n's stable he started working as a groom continuing his training in equestrianism as both a jockey's apprentice and a thoroughbred horse trainer's apprentice.  Banegas regarded  Mr. Concepci\u00f3n as \". . . the only boss he ever had.\"\n\nJockey (1909\u20131912) \n\nIn 1909 he obtained a license to compete as a flat race jockey (see Horse Racing 2.1) debuting with Entrevero, a horse under the training of Mr. El\u00edas Zamora, at the Hip\u00f3dromo de Belgrano (Belgrano Hippodrome).\n\nThe Hippodrome of Belgrano, also known as the Hip\u00f3dromo Nacional (National Hippodrome) and Hip\u00f3dromo Nacional Presidente General Bosch (National Hippodrome President General Bosch), was a racecourse active from 1887 until 1913 which officiated as the counterpart and competitor of the Hip\u00f3dromo Argentino (Argentine Hippodrome) presently the Hip\u00f3dromo Nacional de Palermo (National Hippodrome of Palermo).\n\nHis first victory in 1909 was with Absal\u00f3n, a thoroughbred from the Stable Los Pinos and a brother of Rubicela, with which he won the 1,400 meters race and a subsequent race defeating the legendary dappled thoroughbred Realista from the stables of trainer Mr. Juan Coll, which was ridden by jockey Pedro Claverie.\n\nBanegas third victory was with Ilota trained by Mr. Teller\u00eda with which he won another ten races.  From then on he became one of the leading Argentine jockeys of his time winning at the Hip\u00f3dromo Nacional (National Hippodrome) race season 1909-1910 an unprecedented statistic of 80 times.  Other horses ridden by Banegas during that season were: Florentiona, Solway, Fastidio and L'Emperur, among others.\n\nThat season he later debuted at the Palermo Hippodrome (then National Hippodrome) ridding Bonzo with which he won a second place followed also by a second place with Proserpine.\n\nSteeplechase Jockey (1912\u20131915) \n\nIt was in 1912 when Natalio Cirilo Banegas established himself as the leading Argentine steeplechase jockey, winning thirteen out of the twenty five events he competed in that year, including races at the hippodromes of San Mart\u00edn, Palermo and Longchamps.  Among some significant horses he steeplechased in 1912 were: Cogote, Oskold, Brezo (owned by Mr. Andr\u00e9s Guadalupe) with which he won four victories and Quillay.\n\nBy mid-1913 Banegas had won three out of the seven events in which he had participated, not only in Buenos Aires but also in the city of San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n, riding among others: Soldier Boy, Old Fellow, El Solo, M\u00e1s o Menos and Quillay.\n\nOn 8 January 1913 during a race Banegas suffered a fall in a jump riding Quillay, which caused him a grave brain concussion and left him unable for fifteen days.  Quillay was the offspring of Le Samaritain and Melena, two famous champions and breeders of champions, under the care of trainer Mr. Felipe Viscay.\n\nBanegas continued competing as a steeplechase jockey after the accident into 1914, his last recorded victory being in September 1914 with M\u00e1s o Menos; afterwards, he transitioned to a career as one of the most successful thoroughbred trainers of Argentina.\n\nHorse trainer, Buenos Aires (1915\u20131930) \n\nNatalio Cirilo Banegas trained horses mostly for races at the Palermo Hippodrome (Hip\u00f3dromo Argentino de Palermo) and at the San Isidro Hippodrome (Hip\u00f3dromo de San Isidro) of the City of Buenos Aires as well as for the Hippodrome of the City of La Plata in the Province of Buenos Aires.  Banegas was associated with the leading thoroughbred horse breeding farms of Argentina, among them Stable Condal, owned by Mr. Fernando Sanjurjo, owner of the cigarette factory Condal and Staple Chapadmalal, owned by brothers Miguel and Jose A. Martinez de Hoz.\n\nHistorian Roy Hora indicates in Historia del Turf Argentino (History of the Argentine Horse-racing), in reference to the impact of the economic crisis of the 1930s on Argentine horse-racing and in particular on the Palermo Hippodrome, that \". . .the Jockey Club launched the construction of a stadium of its own.  The work began in 1926, but the Crisis of the Thirties delayed the opening until December of 1935\".  During this period, Hora explains, \"several racecourses in the interior of the country also became more prominent, including. . . Rosario.\"\n\nThe end of 20s and beginning of the 30s found Natalio Cirilo Banegas expanding his professional activity to the City of Rosario, Santa Fe Province training horses for races at the Hip\u00f3dromo Parque de La Independencia (Independence Park Hippodrome), former Rosario Jockey Club's Racecourse.  He definitively settled in Rosario at the beginning of the thirties and from then on, until the end of his career, he trained horses mostly for races at the Independence Park Hippodrome of Rosario and at the Palermo Hippodrome of Buenos Aires.\n\nRosario (1930\u20131967)\n\nHorse trainer, Rosario \u2013 Buenos Aires (1930\u20131967) \n\nNatalio Cirilo Banegas stood out as a trainer of horses for long distance races (3000 meters and 4000 meters), winning the most important prizes and classics and obtaining the highest horse-racing statistics (scores) of his time in Rosario.  Among some prizes and classics won by Banegas were: the President of the Republic Prize, the Classic Pueyrred\u00f3n, Grand Prize Carlos Pellegrini and the Classic Alfredo A. and Oscar P. Casas Prize.\n\nFamous thoroughbreds under the training of Banegas included: Hollis, a horse with which Banegas won the President of the Republic Prize, the Classic Pueyrred\u00f3n and the Grand Prize Carlos Pellegrini, the latter victory with Hollis, on 11 November 1936, was a 3,000 meter race and was won in the record time of 3 minutes 7 seconds.\n\nBravio was another thoroughbred horse with which he once again won the President of the Republic Prize on 9 July 1939; Mantillo still another, which he won additionally the Classic Alfredo A. and Oscar P. Casas on 28 July 1960; and Chillido, from Stable La Estrella, a horse that Natalio Cirilo Banegas shared in partnership with Francisco H. Land\u00f3 Esq., and with which he received multiple prizes.\n\nPress headlines praised Banegas' professional success.  His fame, popularized by the accounts such as El diestro entrenador de Bavio (Bravio's skilled trainer), La jornada de ayer alcanz\u00f3 n\u00fameros eloquentes (Yesterday's ticket reached eloquent numbers), Batacazo!(Blockbuster!).\n\nNatalio Cirilo Banegas was the owner of the Stable Aseg\u00fan and he was also in charge of the Stable Sarmiento, owned by his wife Mrs. Angela Bandoni (Rosario, Argentina 10 May 1907 \u2013 11 August 1985).  Sarmiento Stable's jockey jacket is remembered for its beauty and delicate design, an original creation of Mrs. Banegas, made with a Scottish tartan fabric of beige tones on the front and back, with white sleeves and a cap of the same Scottish tartan fabric with a white visor.\n\nLater years \n\nThe later years were crowned with multiple wins including those with Saint Nichols; Martinica, a mare from Stable JSR and Rimado, a short distance thoroughbred race horse. Natalio Cirilo Banegas envisioned that his profession as a thoroughbred horse trainer would become a family tradition.  Consequently, his son Prof. Oscar Banegas, following in his father's professional footsteps, on 25 June 1961 won the prestigious Alfonso de la Fuente y Chai Prize with Monaca, a dappled mare ridden by jockey Jose Figueroa, this being the last great equestrian victory recorded by the Banegas family which occurred during the decline of equestrianism in Argentina.\n\nReferring back to the valuable information provided by historian Roy Hora in his Historia del Turf Argentino (History of the Argentine Horse-racing) \n\nFor the history of horse-racing in Argentina and of the City of Rosario, Natalio Cirilo Banegas left a legacy as a legendary jockey and trainer and left his family with a tradition for professional excellence, though not in the training of thoroughbred horses, but in teaching, in the case his son Prof. Oscar Banegas, in medicine in the case of his grandson Dr. Rodrigo Natalio Banegas and in classical music in the case of his grandson Fabio L. Banegas.  Both grandsons, twins, have taken his surname and his example of excellence to international recognition.  Natalio Cirilo Banegas died in the City of Rosario on 14 May 1967.\n\nCarlos Gardel \n\nDuring his long career, Natalio Cirilo Banegas enjoyed the friendship of the foremost personalities of the Argentine equestrian world.  Among them was his close friend, the legendary tango singer, composer and actor Carlos Gardel (1890 \u2013 1935), with whom Banegas had a friendship that began before the start of Gardel's artistic life and spanned for more than a quarter of a century.\n\n \nThe friendship between Carlos Gardel and Natalio Cirilo Banegas traced back to the time when Banegas was part of the group of close friendships Gardel had with jockey Irineo Leguisamo and trainer Francisco Maschio, also one of Banegas' mentors.  According to Simon Collier in The Life, Music and Times of Carlos Gardel \"Maschio's stable named Yeru\u00e1, on Olleros Street, was, for Gardel the focus of an alternative barra (group of friends or fans), as strong as any other he ever associated with over the years.\n\nIn his last performance in the City of Rosario, on 21\u201322 April 1933, at the Broadway Theater Carlos Gardel gifted Natalio Cirilo Banegas with one of his gaucho jackets, made with a black satin and embroidered with red roses.  Gardel was photographed wearing this jacket by photographer Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Silva in 1923 and he wore it afterwards in his 1923 concert tour of Spain for 40 performances at the Apollo Theater of Madrid, one of which was attended by one of the Spanish Infantas, Infanta Isabel de Borb\u00f3n y Borb\u00f3n, \"La Chata.\"\n\nA similar gaucho jacket to the one Banegas received from Gardel appeared in films and movie posters as The Tango on Broadway of 1934 and El d\u00eda que me quieras of 1935.  This jacket was also worn alternatively in El d\u00eda que me quieras by actors Tito Luciardo and Manuel Peluffo.  In one of such scenes they sang the tango Suerte Negra in a trio with Carlos Cardel.  Carlos Cardel died tragically on 24 June 1935,\n\nColleagues\n\nHorse trainers \nNatalio Cirilo Banegas maintained close friendships with his colleagues, among them the trainers: Juan Concepci\u00f3n, Francisco Maschio, Naciamo Moreno, El\u00edas Zamora, Teller\u00eda, Felipe Viscay, Andr\u00e9s Guadalupe, Anacleto Galimbertti, Anibal \"Chiquito\" Giovanetti, Della Randart and Lora.\n\nAs the leading thoroughbred horse trainer of his time in the City of Rosario, he mentored and earned the esteem of many colleagues, such as Cecilio Rodriguez, Agapito Gomez, Arturo Capra, Antonio Lema, Carlos \"Gallego\" Varela, Miranda, Agud, Demarchi, Alonso and the Toledo brothers.\n\nJockeys \n\nAmong the jockeys who rode horses prepared by Natalio Cirilo Banegas some of whom became his close friends were: Irineo Leguisamo, Ram\u00f3n Pelletier, Domingo \"Mingo\" Torterolo, Francisco Arcuri, M\u00e1ximo Acosta, Jos\u00e9 Candal, Manuel Lema, Roberto Carabajal, Sebasti\u00e1n Ru\u00edz, and Cayetano Santos \"Pochi\" Sauro, all active in the hippodromes of the city of Buenos Aires.\n\nIn the City of Rosario his horses were ridden among others by the following jockeys: Angel Oscar Baratucci, F\u00e9lix Tomas Rodr\u00edguez, Nicasio Rub\u00e9n \"Machadito\" Machado \u2013 riding among others Mantillo\u2013, Oreste A. Cosenza and the brothers Jorge and Tito Mernies. \n  \nIt is worth mentioning that both Cayetano Santos Sauro and Nicasio Rub\u00e9n Machado came from the same equestrian school as Banegas, and likewise, they started first as grooms in the stables of Belgrano, then became jockey apprentices and finally horse-race jockey champions.\n\nWith respect to Angel Oscar Baratucci, on 15 December 1957, he won at the Independence Hippodrome in the City of Rosario all eight races programmed on that date, thus entering the Guinness Book of World Records, displacing Irineo Leguizamo himself, who held the highest mark of seven races won in one day.  Regarding Cayetano Sauro, who was also one of the most renowned jockeys of his time, his career was cut short after an accident he suffered on 15 February 1969 at the San Isidro Racecourse.\n\nHorse owner \n\nNatalio Cirilo Banegas was sole owner of many thoroughbred horse champions as was the case with Rimado and he trained horses, often in partnerships, with then influential thoroughbred horse owners.  Worth citing are: Mr. Fernando Sanjurjo, owner of the Cigarette Factory Condal and thoroughbred Horse Farm Condal; Mr. Marcel Baurin, shareholder of the automobile company Peugeot and landowner; Messrs. Roberto, Bartolo, Miguel and Fernando Monserrat, owners of Monserrat Bank Ltd., substantial real-estate holders and businessmen in the City of Rosario.\n\nAdditionally Banegas trained horses for Mr. Inri Jesus Araya de Avenada, landowner and founder of Inriville, a town in the Province of C\u00f3rdoba, businessmen 'Mr. Santiago Palma and Mr. Pedro Claverie; industrialist Mr. Miguel Angel Langelotti and Mr. Juan Francisco Rosetti, Lottery Concessionaire of the Province of Santa Fe and also owner of the Stable JFR.\n\nAmong political personas of the time, he trained horses for Mr. Francisco H. Land\u00f3 Esq., Minister of Education of the Province of Santa Fe and Mr. Svetkov, the Acting Mayor of the City of Rosario. Mr. Svetkov was also the godfather of his youngest son Prof. Oscar Banegas.\n\nReferences \n\nHorse trainers\n1893 births\n1967 deaths"}

Initially the unit used the Rosettenville Central School grounds as its parade ground. Around 1990 the unit was relocated to Doornkop Military Base, the old base was repurposed again for school use.\n\nHeadquarters\nThe first headquarters was situated in an old nursery school in Regents Park which was received from the City Council of Johannesburg.\n\nThe unit resorted under the command of Group 18.\n\nBorder Duty\nThe commando performed its first border duty in 1976 (October to December), the second in 1978 (January to March). In the mid 80's the unit was refocused to Urban warefare until its closure in 1994.\n\nNational Colours\nOn Tuesday 26 April 1994, Wemmerpan Commando laid up its National Colours at the South African National Museum of Military History. The laying up of National Colours followed a decision of the Defence Command Council that this should be done owing to the replacement of the National Flag by a new National Flag on 27 April 1994. The laying up of Colours is, in the life of any unit in possession of Colours, an occasion of supreme historical significance.\n\nWith the SANDF\n\nDisbandment\nThis unit, along with all other Commando units was disbanded after a decision by South African President Thabo Mbeki to disband all Commando Units.

It uses a simplified game mechanic using primarily six-sided dice to main attributes and skill challenges, a hex grid for maps, and a \"point-buy\" system for buying skills and powers.\n\nPublication history\nIn 1981, Hero Games published the superhero role-playing game (RPG) Champions that used the \"Hero System\" set of rules. Hero Games subsequently published a second- and third-edition of Champions, as well as a number of role-playing games in other genres that used the same Hero System rules, including the pulp-inspired Justice Inc. (1984), espionage RPG Danger International (1985), and fantasy RPG Fantasy Hero (1986). By this time, Hero Games was in financial difficulty, and was eventually taken over as a subsidiary of Iron Crown Enterprises (I.C.E.). In 1989, Hero Games\/I.C.E. published a fourth edition of Champions that included the latest version of the Hero System rules. Seeing the commercial success of the stand-alone GURPS (Generic Universal Role-Playing System) rules by Steve Jackson Games, Hero Games broke out the rules from the fourth edition of Champions and published them as Hero System Rulesbook in 1990.  \n\nIn the 2014 book Designers & Dragons: The '80s, game historian Shannon Appelcline noted that \"Now GURPS (1986) was gaining steam, and the benefits of a truly universal system were becoming more obvious.

{"eng_Latn":"Goodge Place Market is an outdoor street market in Fitzrovia, in the London Borough of Camden. Licences to trade are issued by Camden London Borough Council.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history (1850\u20131867) \n\nOriginally the market occupied Charles Street (now the stretch of Goodge Street between Charlotte Street and Newman Street. Goodge Place, like Goodge Street, is named for Francis and William Goodge who in 1766 began developing Goodge Street as a shopping street.\n\nUnregulated street markets allowed London to grow explosively in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The traders could move easily to the new population centres and enabled people to buy provisions without having to travel to the central London wholesale markets. In the early morning traders would load their barrows at the wholesale markets, clean and sort the goods, and then sell them in the new suburban streets. In many cases, the sites of these markets became London's modern high streets.\n\nManagement by the police (1867\u20131927) \nIn 1867, section six of the Metropolitan Streets Act effectively prohibited street trading. Following public meetings and press criticism, the act was amended within weeks. Section one of the Metropolitan Streets Act Amendment Act 1867 exempted traders but they were now subject to regulation by the police.\n\nIn 1878 Walford writes that the market was on the south-side of the street and busiest on Friday and Saturday evenings, when most people were paid. He describes it is one of the last street markets in and around the West End of London and doubted it would survive long. Survival owed much to the area's retention of a working and lower-middle class population. This happened to a greater degree than in most neighbouring districts, meaning the area had more in common with areas to the north, than prosperous West End neighbours like Marylebone and Bloomsbury.\n\nFifteen years later the market is described as consisting of 45 stalls and having been established in around 1850. The same report describes the market as being a general market selling food, homewares, flowers, and books.\n\nManagement by local councils (1927\u2013present) \n\nThe London County Council (General Powers) Act 1927 replaced police regulation with a new licensing regime administered by metropolitan borough councils. From 1927 to 1965 the market was managed by the Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras.\n\nIn 1965 the Borough of St Pancras was abolished and its area became part of the London Borough of Camden.\n\nBy 1983 the market had relocated to Goodge Place and Perlmutter describes a small Monday to Saturday market out of keeping with the multinational variety of goods available in the area.\n\nIn the 2000s the market followed the trends of the area and consisted of five international street-food stalls selling food from around the world and serving the Monday to Friday lunch crowds.\n\nTransport\n\nBus \n\nBus Routes 24, 29, 73, and 390.\n\nRailway and tube \n\nThe nearest stations are Goodge Street, Tottenham Court Road, and Warren Street.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n camden.gov.uk\/markets\u2014Camden Council's markets webpages\n Goodge Place Market\u2014National Market Traders Federation\n\nTourist attractions in the London Borough of Camden\n19th-century establishments in England\nRetail markets in London\nFitzrovia"}

Einhorn who had a major influence on his development and subsequent career but tragically died from cancer at age 45 in 1987.\n\nHogarth was a faculty member at INSEAD (1972-1979), the Booth School at the University of Chicago (1979-2001), and Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona (2001\u2013present). At Chicago Booth, he was Director of the Center for Decision Research (1983-1993), and Deputy Dean (1993-1998).\n\nMain professional contributions\n\nHogarth\u2019s work centers on the psychology of judgment and decision making. Together with Einhorn, he published several key papers that helped establish the standing of a new area within psychology. Among other contributions were analyses of the role of rationality in decision making, the use of simple models, learning (and not learning) from experience, effects of ambiguity in decision making, and the probabilistic nature of causal judgments.\n\nIn 1985, Hogarth, together with economist Melvyn W. Reder, organized a 2-day conference at the University of Chicago on the topic of deviations from rational economic behavior. The conference was marked by the participation of many leading scholars (including 9 winners or future winners of the Nobel prize) who debated the meaning of data that did not comply with the assumptions of economic theory and yet were consistent with some psychological principles. This meeting and debate by highly qualified economists and psychologists has been recognized as an important milestone in the development of the disciplines of behavioral economics and behavioral finance.\n\nIntrigued by the work of Gerd Gigerenzer and colleagues on the surprising efficacy of simple heuristic models for decision making, Hogarth undertook a series of theoretical analyses to understand why. These investigations were important in defining the possibilities and limits of some simple heuristic methods and emphasized the importance of characterizing the nature of environmental conditions appropriately.\n\nIn 2001, Hogarth published Educating Intuition (University of Chicago Press), a book that reviewed the psychological literature on intuitive judgment and offered suggestions on how this could be improved or \u201ceducated.\u201d  Key to this is the issue of the conditions under which intuitive responses have been learned and these, according to Hogarth, can vary from kind to wicked. Kind learning environments are characterized by repeated judgments and feedback that is both immediate and clear. Under these conditions, people acquire appropriate responses, i.e., intuitions. On the contrary, in wicked learning environments, feedback may be missing, slow, distorted or biased in other ways and the acquisition of appropriate responses is compromised. The differential effects of kind and wicked learning environments can have important consequences and these have been used to explain many important phenomena.  In recent years, Hogarth has explored some of these in academic papers as well as a book.\n\nHogarth was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by University of Lausanne in 2007.\n\nBooks\n Hogarth, R. M.

{"eng_Latn":"Anarchism in Paraguay has held influence among the urban and rural working classes since the end of the 19th century. Its main figure was the writer and journalist Rafael Barrett.\n\nBeginnings \nThe anarchists were active in the graphic, railway and baker's unions as early as 1889, organizing the fight for the 8-hour workday. On March 1 of that year, the railway workers declared a strike of significant proportions, other guilds soon followed. On May 21, 1892, the first libertarian manifesto was published, edited by the group \"Los Hijos del Chaco\": they declared themselves anarcho-communist and intended to abolish private property, the clergy, the State and the armed forces. At the same time, several libertarian unions were organized, particularly among carpenters. In 1900, the Italian anarchist Pietro Gori, temporarily based in Argentina, drafted the statute of the bricklayers union. The carpenters eventually achieved the 8-hour day in 1901, after a week on strike.Cappelletti, Angel & Rama, Carlos.  El anarquismo en Am\u00e9rica Latina , Edit. Ayacucho, Caracas, 1990, pg. LXXVII. During this time, Spanish and Argentine immigrants played an important role in spreading the anarchist ideal in Paraguay.\n\n20th century \nThe Paraguayan Regional Workers Federation was founded on April 22, 1906, organized under the anarcho-syndicalist model of the FORA. It declared itself opposed to all political parties, proposing to fight for the \"Federation of Associates and Free Producers\" as its objective. Its mouthpiece was the newspaper El Despertar. The anarchists in Paraguay were particularly influential among the peasants, even organizing \"Societies in Armed Resistance\" to confront landowners.\n\nRafael Barret was the outstanding figure of the movement; From his magazine Germinal \"he described the social tragedy of the Paraguayan worker, denounced the inhuman exploitation which the peasants were subjected to, practicing a form of investigative journalism that was advanced for his time. His articles included: \"What are the grasslands\", \"The Argentine terror\", \"My anarchism\", \"Eloquence\", \"The Paraguayan pain\", etc. He arrived in Paraguay in 1904 from Argentina, as a correspondent for the newspaper El Tiempo. In 1908 he was forced into exile in Montevideo and died of tuberculosis in 1910. \n\nAnother renowned Paraguayan cultural figure was Ignacio N\u00fa\u00f1ez Soler, a prominent Paraguayan anarchist and visual artist. In 1916 he founded, together with Leopoldo Ramos Gim\u00e9nez, Modesto Amarilla, Manuel N\u00fa\u00f1ez and others, a working-class entity called May Day, whose social insignia was a black flag. Based on this organization, the Centro Obrero Regional del Paraguay (CORP) was later created, which organized branches in almost all the cities and towns of Paraguay and published journals such as: El Combate, Renewal, Human Protest and Prometheus.\n\nDuring the first decade of the 20th century, the newspapers La Rebeli\u00f3n, La Tribuna and Towards the Future were published. Between 1920 and 1926, Renovation was published. The FORP and the Combate group published brochures by Rafael Barret. In 1928, the anarchists founded the Revolutionary Nationalist Alliance, whose strategy was the implantation of a \"Common Republic\" and the \"Federalist Union of the Peoples of Latin America\". On February 20, 1931, a student-worker group led by Obdulio Barthe took the city of Encarnaci\u00f3n declaring it a \"revolutionary commune\", under the leadership of popular assemblies. This was just a stage in a plan to start a libertarian socialist revolution throughout Paraguay. Anarchists that participated in this episode included F\u00e9lix Cantalicio Aracuy\u00fa, Ram\u00f3n Dur\u00e1n, Ciriaco Duarte, Juan Verdi, etc.\n\n21st century \nThe resurgence of anarchism took much longer in Paraguay than in other Latin American countries, prolonged due to the radical right-wing movement that took hold of Paraguayan society as a result of the Chaco War and a series of military dictatorships. In the first years of the 21st century, anarchist tendencies began to be noticed in punk counterculture groups and individuals related to social and cultural struggles. Squatters opened \"La Terraza\" and \"\u00d1ande\", and the anarchist social center \"The Commune of Emma Chana And all the others\". Anarchists also published periodicals such as Autonom\u00eda Zine, Diatriba, Perif\u00e9rica, Grito Fanzine, Abstruso, Kupi'i fanzine and the Agitation Without Permission newspaper. Graffiti on the capital's walls and the presence of anarchist flags in marches and demonstrations in recent years demonstrate the awakening of some interest in individuals towards libertarian tendencies that begin to interact with left-wing groups and social sectors.\n\nReferences\n\nAnarchism in Paraguay\nHistory of Paraguay\nParaguay\nAnarchism"}

{"eng_Latn":"The Last of Us Part II, a 2020 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, focuses on two lead characters: Ellie, who sets out for revenge after suffering a great tragedy, and Abby Anderson, a soldier who becomes involved in a conflict between her militia and a cult. The switch between the playable characters was a major point of the game's development, based on a similar switch in the original game, 2013's The Last of Us.\n\nPart of the game deals with Ellie's relationship with Joel, the first game's protagonist, who lied to her. Ellie is joined by several companions in the game, including her girlfriend Dina, friend Jesse, and Joel's brother Tommy. Abby is a member of the Washington Liberation Front, which also includes her ex-boyfriend Owen and her friend Manny, and is led by Isaac. Throughout her journey, Abby meets and protects Yara and Lev, siblings from the opposing cult known as the Seraphites.\n\nCreative director Neil Druckmann co-wrote the story and developed the characters of Part II with Halley Gross. The performances were recorded using performance capture, which records motion and voice simultaneously. Actors were given considerable license to improvise or suggest ideas while performing. One of the writers' goals was to create multifaceted characters, especially in Ellie, and they wanted to explore the vulnerabilities of Abby to ensure that the player could empathize with her. The characters received a mixed reception, with acclaim for the performances.\n\nCreation and conception \n\nFor The Last of Us Part II, the actors' performances were recorded at a studio in Playa Vista, Los Angeles using performance capture, recording motion and voice simultaneously. The actors wore motion capture suits and head-mounted cameras that track facial muscles and eye movements. Recording ran from 2017 to April 2019. The actors were allowed to improvise or suggest ideas while performing; he said that he would do \"20 or 30 takes if need be\". Co-writer Halley Gross noted that a goal of the writers was to \"create the most multifaceted characters you've seen in games\". She particularly wanted to explore the multifaceted behavior of Ellie, showing her power as well as her insecurities. She wanted the story to show that \"there are no heroes or villains\". Writer and director Neil Druckmann found that all three playable characters\u2014Joel in the first game, and Ellie and Abby in Part II\u2014mirror each other as they are all suffering with overcoming trauma and \"quietening their demons\".\n\nThe change of player character from Ellie to Abby was inspired by the change from Joel to Ellie in the first game, though emphasized in Part II due to its focus on empathy. Druckmann found that players acted differently when forced to play as Ellie in the first game, and wanted to replicate a similar change with Abby in Part II. Druckmann was also inspired by the character switch of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001), which had been suppressed in that game's marketing. The writers experimented with interspersing Ellie and Abby's gameplay sections, but ultimately settled on longer segments. Druckmann found that Ellie's attempt for revenge was mirrored by Abby, who had already achieved it by avenging her father. Early playtests of the final fight led to confusion regarding Ellie's decision to spare Abby; the editorial team suggested adding a flash of Joel playing guitar, which Druckmann felt was an effective balance between explicit and implicit motivation. For more than half of production, Ellie killed Abby in the game's conclusion, and would return to the farm and be tortured but spared by a relative of somebody Ellie killed. Druckmann felt that this was thematically relevant, but realized that it focused too heavily on the themes rather than characters; after conversations about Yara and Lev, they found that it felt dishonest and that Ellie still had some goodness. Druckmann wanted players to support both characters in the final fight, and realize how futile it is.\n\nLead characters\n\nEllie \n\nEllie (Ashley Johnson) is a playable protagonist of The Last of Us Part II. Two years after the events of the first game, Ellie returned to the Firefly hospital and learned the truth from Joel. The main plot of Part II takes place two years later, where Ellie and Joel have built a life in Jackson, though it is evident their relationship is still strained. Ellie and her girlfriend Dina leave Jackson in search of Joel and Tommy. Ellie enters the Washington Liberation Front (WLF) camp to witness Abby Anderson beat Joel to death, and swears revenge. Ellie and Dina head to the WLF base in Seattle, where Tommy has gone. After escaping a WLF ambush, the pair retreat to a theater, where Ellie reveals her immunity to Dina and learns that Dina is pregnant. The next day, with Dina sick, Ellie pursues Tommy alone and encounters Dina's ex-boyfriend Jesse, who has followed them to Seattle. Evading the Seraphites, a cult fighting the WLF for control of Seattle, Ellie tracks another WLF member, Nora Harris, to a hospital, and tortures her for information.\n\nThe next day, Jesse leaves to pursue Tommy, and Ellie heads to Abby's hideout at an aquarium. After a struggle, Ellie kills Abby's allies, the pregnant Mel and her boyfriend Owen Moore. Returning to the theater, Ellie, Dina, Jesse and Tommy are ambushed by Abby, who kills Jesse and shoots Tommy. She overpowers Ellie and Dina, but spares them and warns them to leave. Some time later, Ellie and Dina are living on a farm, taking care of Dina's baby, but Ellie suffers from posttraumatic stress. When Tommy arrives with information on Abby's whereabouts, Ellie leaves for Santa Barbara to kill her, despite Dina's pleas. She is injured in a trap but escapes and rescues Abby and Lev, who have been weakened by weeks of torture. Threatening to kill Lev, Ellie forces Abby to fight her. Ellie overpowers her, losing two fingers in the process, but lets her live. Ellie returns to the farmhouse and finds it empty. She plays Joel's guitar, recalls her promise to Joel to try to forgive him, and leaves.\n\nFor her portrayal as the primary playable character, Johnson took lessons she learned working with Baker on the first game. Johnson considered her own experiences with anxiety, and researched the effects of posttraumatic stress disorder with Druckmann. Ellie's excitement for astronomy was based on Johnson's own interests, while her obsession with comics is based on Druckmann's childhood. Gross felt that Ellie's decision to track down Abby was motivated by her desire to overcome her PTSD more than her desire to kill Abby. Gross, who has suffered twice from PTSD, considered it her responsibility to accurately depict the subject matter. The writers wanted to deconstruct the perception of violence in Joel and Ellie: while Joel is indifferent and practical, Ellie kills to maintain a \"culture of honor\" by attaching violence to her ego. Some of the team considered Ellie's obsession with Abby akin to a drug addiction, and that Dina left as she felt that the obsession would never end. Johnson received acclaim for her performance, and she was nominated for several awards.\n\nAbby \n\nAbigail \"Abby\" Anderson (Laura Bailey) is a playable protagonist of Part II. Her father, Jerry Anderson, was a Firefly surgeon who Joel killed at the end of the first game to save Ellie. Four years later, in her early twenties, she tracks Joel down and beats him to death. Some time later, back in Seattle, Abby learns that her ex-boyfriend Owen has gone missing while investigating the Seraphites. The WLF leader, Isaac Dixon, believes he may have defected, and plans to assault the Seraphites' island settlement. Searching for Owen, Abby is captured and witnesses the Seraphites shatter the arm of a runaway Seraphite, Yara. After being rescued by Yara's younger brother Lev, they arrive at the aquarium, where Abby finds Owen. He plans to sail to Santa Barbara, where the Fireflies were supposedly regrouping. Yara's arm requires amputation, so Abby and Lev retrieve medical supplies from the hospital, which is overrun by Infected. Lev runs away to the Seraphite settlement to convince their mother to leave the cult. Abby and Yara pursue him, fending off an attack from Tommy.\n\nAt the settlement, they discover Lev has killed his devout mother in self-defense. As the WLF attack the settlement, Yara kills Isaac and sacrifices herself to let Abby and Lev escape. Abby and Lev return to the aquarium to find Owen and his pregnant girlfriend Mel killed and a map leading to Ellie's theater hideout. At the theater, Abby kills Jesse, shoots Tommy, and overpowers Ellie and Dina. Learning that Dina is pregnant, Abby spares them at Lev's insistence and warns them to leave. Some time later, Abby and Lev arrive in Santa Barbara searching for the Fireflies, but are captured by the Rattlers, slave-keeping bandits. After being weakened by weeks of torture, they are rescued by Ellie. Threatening to kill Lev, Ellie forces Abby to fight her. Ellie overpowers her, but lets her live. Abby sails away with Lev towards the Firefly base on Catalina Island.\n\nAbby is described as having a \"commanding presence\", with her physical build reflecting the years of training and combat. Her design underwent several iterations, with the goal to portray her as \"capable, utilitarian, and strong\". Druckmann wanted to avoid casting Bailey due to her proliferation of roles, but was impressed with her audition tape in how she had played into Abby's vulnerability. Bailey worked out in preparation for the role, and gave birth to her first son during production. She prepared by researching people involved in wars and their coping mechanisms. Abby's face is based on Jocelyn Mettler, a visual effects artist who formerly worked at Naughty Dog, while her body was based on athlete Colleen Fotsch. Abby's character was well-received, though her playable chapters were controversial among players, and Bailey became the target of online death threats; some critics felt that the character had been unfairly maligned, and that criticisms of her muscular physique was a result of the lack of body diversity in games. Bailey received acclaim for her performance; she won accolades at the British Academy Games Awards, the Game Awards, and the NAVGTR Awards.\n\nJoel \n\nJoel Miller (Troy Baker) is Ellie's surrogate father, and the protagonist of the first game. In the prologue to The Last of Us Part II, Joel confesses his guilt to his brother Tommy. Flashbacks in the game reveal Joel taking Ellie on a birthday trip to a museum, and him finally admitting the truth to her when she travels to the hospital. Four years after the first game, Joel and Ellie have built a life in Jackson, though their relationship is strained due to Ellie finding out the truth. While on patrol, Joel and Tommy save Abby, a stranger, from Infected and they escape a large horde, returning to an outpost run by Abby's group. Joel and Tommy are attacked by Abby's group, revealed to be ex-Fireflies who are now part of the WLF, a militia group based in Seattle. Ellie finds them but is assaulted and watches helplessly as Abby beats Joel to death.\n\nDruckmann felt that Joel's character arc was complete after the first game. Joel's death was a core part of the game's narrative structure from early in development; though it initially caused some internal resistance, the team felt compelled when more of the narrative was built out. An early version of Joel's death scene had him utter \"Sarah\", his daughter's name, until Baker suggested that he should remain silent. While Sarah's death in the first game intended to evoke sadness, Joel's death aims to elicit anger. Druckmann felt that witnessing Joel's death through Ellie's perspective emphasized the anger of the player. He wanted it to be portrayed as \"gross, unceremonious, and humiliating\" instead of heroic. He predicted that it might lead to negative reactions from players, but felt it was necessary to tell the story; he particularly felt that Naughty Dog's notability in the industry gave it the opportunity to take risks that other developers can not. When designing Joel for Part II, the art team ensured that he maintained his identifiable look while also showing the stress of the last five years.\n\nGamesRadar+s Alex Avard found that Baker \"steals some of [the game's] best scenes as Joel\" by adding complexities that enrich the character and relationships. Evan Lewis of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Baker \"deserves every accolade possible for his heart-wrenching performance\". IGNs Dornbush lauded Baker's performance for depicting the weariness of Joel. For his role, Baker won Outstanding Supporting Performance in a Drama at the NAVGTR Awards. He was nominated for Performer in a Supporting Role at the 17th British Academy Games Awards.\n\nSecondary characters\n\nTommy \n\nTommy (Jeffrey Pierce) is Joel's brother, and one of the founders of the community in Jackson. In the game's prologue, Joel confesses his guilt to Tommy. Four years later, Tommy witnesses Joel's death while on patrol, but he is spared by Abby and her group. After insisting that Ellie remain in Jackson, Tommy sneaks away overnight, seeking revenge in Seattle. He interrogates and kills several WLF soldiers, including Abby's friends Nick and Manny. He finds and attacks Abby, but is stabbed by Yara and pushed into the ocean. He regroups with Ellie, Dina, and Jesse, but is ambushed by Abby and Lev. He is shot in the leg by Lev and the head by Abby; he survives, but is blind in one eye and limps. Several months later, he visits Ellie and Dina on their farm, revealing that he and his wife Maria had split. Tommy presents Ellie with information regarding Abby's whereabouts and demands that she kill her in his place. After Ellie refuses, Tommy berates her, prompting Dina to argue with him. He ignores her and rides away on his horse.\n\nPierce felt that Tommy convincing Ellie to chase Abby at the farm is him attempting to erase his shame, comparing it to \"bombing the shit out of Iraq after 9\/11\", which is \"not quite the right target there, but ... made some people feel righteous\". He described the actions as \"Greek tragedy-level stupidity\", but felt that it was a human action. Early iterations of the scene had Maria visit Ellie, but she was replaced with Tommy so that Ellie \"would have to face Abby's impact\". When designing Tommy for Part II, the team wanted to show his advanced age while maintaining his identity from the first game. For his work on the game, Pierce was nominated for Performer in a Supporting Role at the 17th British Academy Games Awards.\n\nDina \n\nDina (Shannon Woodward) is Ellie's girlfriend. She originally hails from New Mexico and is Jewish, mentioning that her ancestors survived both the Spanish Inquisition and the Holocaust. She is an orphan who was forced to learn how to handle herself since the age of 10. The day after their first kiss at a dance, Dina and Ellie are assigned to patrol together. Taking shelter from a blizzard, they smoke marijuana and passionately kiss. When her ex-boyfriend Jesse finds them, they split up to find Joel. Dina eventually finds a beaten Ellie mourning over the death of Joel. She travels with Ellie to Seattle to seek revenge, but is forced to rest in a theater when she reveals her pregnancy with Jesse. When Abby ambushes the theater, she overpowers Dina and threatens to kill her, but ultimately spares her at Lev's insistence. Some time later, Dina and Ellie are living on a farm, raising her son, JJ. When Ellie discovers information of Abby's whereabouts, Dina pleads for her to stay, but Ellie refuses. When Ellie eventually returns, she finds the farm empty.\n\nGross connected Woodward, with whom she had worked on Westworld, with Druckmann. A fan of Westworld, Druckmann spoke with Woodward for several months before offering her an audition to play Dina. Johnson recalled that the team had narrowed the potential cast to around four actors. After testing with Woodward, Johnson felt that they immediately had chemistry; Woodward was later cast as the character. Woodward found Dina to be an extension of herself. She felt that some people deal with trauma through comedy, and would often improvise jokes while recording. Dina underwent extensive design changes in development; early iterations featured patterns that were deemed impractical for stealth, though the team wanted her style to embody pre-pandemic life. Dina's face is based on actress Cascina Caradonna. \n\nDruckmann decided that Dina would be Jewish fairly early in development. He felt that she struggles with the religion, not believing every part of the Torah, but her relationship with it remains important to her. Her name means \"judgment\" in Hebrew, which he felt reflected on the game's themes. As a narrative function, Dina represented the community of Jackson, and what Ellie stood to lose from her revenge mission. Her presence allowed Ellie moments of light; the team felt that she \"amplifies the better parts of Ellie\". Gross had originally written an extended monologue for Ellie to perform to Dina about her fear of ruining their friendship. Her sense of humor helps her forget her traumatic past.\n\nAndrew Webster of The Verge described Dina as a \"charismatic and honest counterpart to Ellie's more headstrong personality\", particularly noting the emptiness of her absence. Jonathon Dornbush of IGN commended Woodward's performance, especially during the game's quieter moments. The Washington Posts Gene Park described Dina as \"quietly revolutionary\" for the depiction of her Jewish heritage. NPRs Kaity Kline considered Dina the first Jewish video game character that she could relate to. For her work on the game, Woodward was nominated for Performer in a Supporting Role at the 17th British Academy Games Awards.\n\nJesse \n\nJesse (Stephen Chang) is Dina's ex-boyfriend. He leads the patrol early in the game and discovers that Joel and Tommy are not at their post. After informing Ellie and Dina, the three split to search for them. Jesse eventually finds a wounded Tommy, unconscious Ellie, and dead Joel. After Ellie, Dina, and Tommy head to Seattle to avenge Joel, Jesse sneaks out to follow. He finds Ellie in a suburban neighborhood in Seattle, regrouping with her and Dina. Jesse deciphers Dina's pregnancy, but does not discuss it with her. The following day, he heads out with Ellie, but the two eventually split when they hear of Tommy's whereabouts; Jesse tracks down Tommy, while Ellie continues her search for Abby. Jesse and Tommy eventually find Ellie and the aquarium, and the three return to Dina. That night, when Tommy is ambushed, Jesse races in to the room and is shot in the face by Abby, killing him instantly. Several months later, Dina gives birth to his child, JJ.\n\nChang felt a connection to the character and noted that the team allowed him to \"bring a lot of myself to the character\". In creating Jesse, the concept team wanted him to appear experienced and loyal, with a strong moral compass. He was one of the easier characters to design, representing the \"rugged, strong American cowboy\".\n\nLev \nLev (Ian Alexander) is a former member of the Seraphites, and the brother of Yara. After Lev, born as Lily, transitioned to male, the siblings were ostracized from the group and forced to flee. Lev saves Yara after the latter is captured by Seraphites. Abby helps the siblings find safety for the night. The following day, she takes them to her friends Owen and Mel. After being invited by Owen to escape to Santa Barbara, Lev, unwilling to leave their mother behind, travels to the Seraphites' island in an effort to convince her to leave. He kills his mother while defending himself. As they leave the island, Yara sacrifices herself so Lev and Abby can escape. They find Owen and Mel dead; Lev helps Abby track Ellie's whereabouts, but they spare her. Abby and Lev eventually travel to Santa Barbara, where they contact the Fireflies, but are captured by a bandit group. Some time later, Ellie frees Abby, who sails away on a boat with Lev. The two eventually make it to Catalina Island, the location of the Fireflies.\n\nOriginally in development, Lev was not transgender. When exploring the idea of making him transgender, the team found it to be an interesting look into the violence that can be found within organized religion. Queer and transgender employees of Naughty Dog gave input on the character, and the team consulted with an LGBTQ scholar. When the developers reached out to acting agencies to cast for the character, they found that none represented transgender actors. Some members of the team were fans of The OA (2016\u20132019), which starred Alexander, who was not represented by an agency at the time; Naughty Dog contacted The OA director Zal Batmanglij to get in touch. Druckmann invited Alexander to audition, and the latter submitted some self-taped videos. They worked on the game for three years.\n\nAlexander was attracted to the role as they underwent similar emotions when transitioning, having come from a Mormon background and also receiving backlash after cutting their hair. However, they noted that a significant difference was that, while Lev used his faith as a Seraphite as comfort, Alexander abandoned their religion to cope with the discrimination. They felt that Lev has been forced to grow up due to his surroundings. Despite some hesitation, the team determined that Lev's deadname being used by the Seraphites demonstrated the difference between their transphobia and the acceptance of Abby and Yara. The team hired a religious consultant to ensure the Seraphites' response to Lev's transition was accurate without being unintentionally offensive. Druckmann considered Lev among the most important characters as he represents the same innocence that Ellie did in the first game. Lev's name is based on the Hebrew interpretation of the word \"heart\" and is an homage to the character from David Benioff's City of Thieves (2008), one of Druckmann's favorite novels.\n\nSome members of the transgender community objected to the representation of Lev. Criticism focused on the use of Lev's deadname by villains, that he was created by cisgender writers, and the use of trans stories as tragedies. Writing for Paste, Waverly praised the choice to have Lev played by a transgender actor, but felt there was too much emphasis on his gender identity and the suffering he experienced for it. Waverly felt that \"Lev's story isn't made for trans people, but to give cisgender players a space to connect with their guilt and pity for trans people\". In contrast, Stacey Henley of VG247 wrote that, while Lev's story is not perfect, \"it's a major step for trans characters in gaming, focuses on a highly charismatic and central character who is far more than this transness\". Kotakus Riley MacLeod saw Lev's character as simply a way of the game acknowledging trans people exist and wrote that it was up to players to create their own meaning from the character.\n\nYara \nYara (Victoria Grace) is Lev's sister, and a member of the Seraphites. After Lev transitioned to male, the siblings were forced to flee. Yara is captured by Seraphites and has her left arm shattered before being saved by Lev. Abby helps the siblings find safety for the night. The following day, she takes them to her friends Owen and Mel; the latter, a surgeon, determines that Yara has compartment syndrome and is forced to amputate her arm. Yara accepts Owen's invitation to escape to Santa Barbara, but Lev, unwilling to leave their mother behind, travels to the Seraphites' island. Yara and Abby track Lev and find that he has killed their mother while defending himself. As they leave the island, Yara kills the WLF leader, sacrificing herself so Lev and Abby can escape.\n\nAn early pitch in development was for Yara to be transgender instead of Lev, but Druckmann preferred to keep her a more traditional follower of the Seraphites. Grace was familiar with The Last of Us prior to receiving the role. Her mother found the role through a job listing under a code name. Grace was immediately interested in the role due to Yara's \"strength, bravery, and selflessness\". After sending a tape, she was invited for a callback, where she met with Druckmann and acted alongside Bailey and Gross. Grace felt that, as the youngest of five siblings, her close bond with her family was carried across to the role: \"I would take a hammer to the arm for any of my siblings\". She appreciated that the writers allowed the characters to be defined by their personalities instead of just their Asian American background. Yara's casual clothing represents her transition to a carefree outlook, in contrast to her restrictive upbringing.\n\nManny \nEmanuel \"Manny\" Alvarez (Alejandro Edda) is a former Firefly who serves with Abby, his friend, as a soldier of the Washington Liberation Front. When Abby beats Joel to death, Manny spits on Joel's corpse. He drives Abby and Mel towards the WLF base when they are attacked by Seraphites, forcing them to continue on foot. That night, he helps Abby sneak out from the base to find Owen. Two days later, Manny is sent to the marina to secure boats for the planned invasion of the Seraphites, but his crew is killed in a shootout with Tommy. He soon encounters Abby and the two work their way towards Tommy, but Tommy shoots Manny in the head, killing him instantly.\n\nEdda previously worked with Naughty Dog on Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (2016). Naughty Dog's casting director, Becky Todd, contacted Edda while he was spending Christmas with his grandmother in Mexico, informing him that Druckmann wanted to speak with him; the two spoke on the phone, and Druckmann offered him the role of Manny. Edda, who has little other experience with video games, accepted as he found it to be a unique and creative experience. During production, Druckmann allowed Edda to be creative with his performance, adding small details to the character as he deemed appropriate; for example, Edda felt that Manny would drink mezcal instead of whiskey, as had been suggested in the script, and the line was changed. During Joel's death scene, Edda portrayed Manny as Abby's bodyguard, with a cold and tough disposition, though he acknowledged that the scene was emotional as it was his final shot with Baker. Edda felt that, with Manny, Abby was able to speak more comfortably and openly. Manny's final scenes on the marina were among the last to be shot in the day, and Edda felt that the fatigue of the actors added to the intensity and desperation of their performances. Manny's design was based on Edda's physical appearance, which added more time to his work on the game; he worked on it for about two years.\n\nReception \n\nThe characters received a mixed reception. Kirk McKeand of VG247 described every character as \"complex and human\". Destructoids Chris Carter felt empathetic to the main characters, a sentiment echoed by IGNs Dornbush, who found Ellie's development particularly \"riveting\". Kotakus MacLeod and Times Eliana Dockterman appreciated the diversity of characters. Andy McNamara of Game Informer found the occasional absence of supporting characters alarming, having grown close to them. Webster of The Verge praised the relationship between Ellie and Dina, though noted some dissonance in the former's behavior between gameplay and cutscene. Similarly, GameSpots Kallie Plagge found Abby's character development incongruous with her \"onslaught of combat against human enemies\". Polygons Maddy Myers and Vices Rob Zacny criticized the characters' inability to learn from their mistakes. GameRevolutions Michael Leri found the new characters were less appealing compared to those in previous Naughty Dog games. Yannick Le Fur of Jeuxvideo.com wrote that supporting characters such as Jesse and Manny lacked development and were simply used to advance the narrative.\n\nCritics praised the cast's performances, particularly that of Johnson, Baker, and Bailey. VG247s McKeand found that the game's performances made the narrative moments more powerful. Tim Biggs of The Sydney Morning Herald lauded the performances for making the characters believable. Entertainment Weeklys Lewis felt that the acting saved the game \"from being swallowed by its own darkness\". James Dyer of Empire described the performances as \"incredibly nuanced, big-screen worthy\", additionally naming Woodward and Alexander as standouts. Keza MacDonald of The Guardian wrote that the acting made the narrative much more emotionally effective.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography \n\nLists of Naughty Dog characters\nCharacters\nSony Interactive Entertainment characters"}
{"eng_Latn":"Forge is a level editor developed by Bungie and 343 Industries for the first-person shooter video game series Halo. Forge was initially released alongside Halo 3, and was further expanded upon in Halo: Reach, Halo 4, Halo 2: Anniversary, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Infinite.\n\nUpon Halo 3'''s release, Forge received critical acclaim for its ease of use and versatility. Bungie subsequently released multiple maps designed for Forge editing in both Halo 3 and Halo: Reach. As of 2019, over 6.6 million user-created maps have been created using Forge.\n\nFunction\nIn Halo 3, Forge is an in-game map editor designed for adjusting weapon, vehicle, and prop placement. While in Editor Mode, the player becomes a floating robot, or \"monitor\", who can spawn, move, and delete any game object on the map. All objects are assigned a monetary value, and cost money to spawn; the level's \"Forge budget\" determines how much money the player can use to spawn objects. Unlike conventional level editors, map geometry can't be moved or deleted in Halo 3 Forge, but props (such as crates and concrete barriers) can be used to create makeshift walls and blockades. Later updates to Halo 3 added DLC maps specifically designed for Forge editing, with expanded prop lists that allow players to create rudimentary maps out of blocks, slopes, and panels.\n\nThe Halo: Reach iteration of Forge received multiple new features, such as the ability to phase objects through one another, suspend objects in mid-air, and adjust object placement in finer increments through \"nudging\". These additions were later back-ported to Halo 3 in an update to Halo: The Master Chief Collection.\n\nHistory\nDevelopment on Forge began only 6 months prior to the launch of Halo 3; according to Bungie producer Allen Murray, multiple \"small UI features\" had to be cut to accommodate its inclusion. Forge was first unveiled in August 2007 at the Leipzig Games Convention.Halo 5: Forge, a free standalone version of Halo 5s map editing tool, was released for Windows 10 on September 8, 2016.\n\nIn August 2019, 343 Industries transferred over 6.6 million Forge maps created on the Xbox 360 versions of Halo 3, Halo: Reach, and Halo 4 to Halo: The Master Chief Collection.\n\nForge was left unimplemented for the 2019 Windows release of Halo: The Master Chief Collection, but was later added with Halo 3'''s launch in July 2020. With the release of Forge on Windows, Halo 3 Forge received multiple new features back-ported from Halo: Reach.\n\nOn July 15, 2022, players enrolled in the Xbox Insider Program for Halo Infinite got access to a beta version of the game as a test flight for the upcoming co-op campaign feature. Within this build of the game, dataminers were able to access an early version of Halo Infinite's Forge and leak gameplay footage across social media sites, surprisingly to the approval of 343 Industries. Halo Infinite's Forge was released in the form of an official beta version on November 8, 2022 as part of the Winter Update.\n\nReception\nAs a component of Halo 3, Forge received critical acclaim upon its release. GameSpot Jeff Gerstmann described Forge as \"an extremely powerful addition that might just take over your life\", and praised the editor for the replay value it provided. Heather Campbell of Play Magazine named Halo 3 her game of the year due to Forge, with co-editor Greg Orlando explaining later in the issue: \"What separates Halo 3 from other console shooters such as Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and Team Fortress 2, though, is the inclusion of a forge mode and the ability to save and edit gameplay films. [...] Although these modes are standard fare in most PC online shooters, their inclusion in a console game is something entirely new \u2014 and entirely wonderful.\" In an editorial for Edge, N'Gai Croal stated that Forge could \"help prove the viability of user-generated content on consoles.\" Halo 3s iteration of Forge has received comparisons to Garry's Mod, a 2004 Half-Life 2 mod with a similar emphasis on free-form construction and experimentation.\n\nLegacy\nOutside of its intended use as a map editor, Forge has been used to create art installations by arranging in-game props to draw pictures and write messages. Game modes and maps created in Forge have occasionally informed the development of Halo itself. Grifball, a fictional sport that originated in the Halo-themed web series Red vs. Blue, inspired a popular user-created Forge map and game mode styled after rugby. Grifball was developed into an official weekly playlist for Halo 3, and would go on to be included in every subsequent Halo game after Halo: Reach.\n\n343 Industries employee Nick Bird, working as Forge Quality Assurance on Halo Infinite, credited Forge for his interest in game development; \"My time in Forge and the Forge community eventually led me to pursue a career in the industry, and ultimately landed me a position to work on what I love in a franchise I love.\"\n\nIn September 2021, the developers of the first-person portal-based shooter Splitgate announced that they intend to incorporate their proprietary version of a Forge mode into the game, which launched before the long-delayed Halo Infinite released its version.\n\nReferences\n\nHalo (franchise)\nVideo game level editors"}

{"eng_Latn":"Ultra Mono is the third studio album by British rock band Idles, released on 25 September 2020 by Partisan Records.\nFollowing on from their previous album Joy as an Act of Resistance, the album further explores themes established in the band's previous works such as critique of capitalism, revolution, class struggle, mental health and toxic masculinity, as well as the positive and negative aspects of the band's newfound fame.\n\nThe record was supported by five singles prior to its release, the first of which was the promotional single \"Mr. Motivator\", released on 19 May 2020. This was followed by the lead single \"Grounds\" on 16 June 2020, \"A Hymn\" on 14 July 2020, \"Model Village\" on 11 August 2020 and \"War\" which coincided with the release of the album on 25 September 2020.\n\nBackground and production \nFollowing the release and success of their 2018 album Joy as an Act of Resistance, Idles received mainstream attention and toured extensively in support of it. The band confirmed in an Instagram post in January 2019 that they were writing new music and in March, debuted a new song called \"War\" during an exclusive show for Dr. Martens. Another new song, \"Grounds\", was debuted in Glasgow during the band's UK tour in December 2019. Both songs were played at the band's final show of the tour at Alexandra Palace alongside another new track called \"Danke\".\n\nIn an interview with DIY following the album's announcement in June 2020, lead singer Joe Talbot opened up about the themes and inspiration behind the album, saying: \"Emotionally I\u2019m not healed, I\u2019m healing and that\u2019s what\u2019s on the record. So this one is about processing and finding pragmatic ways of moving forward, and from your reaction to that trauma, you build something concise and beautiful (...) the songs are all projections of inner workings, I\u2019m not preaching or telling anyone else what to do. I\u2019m showing people what I\u2019m doing to become a better person in the long run - no, not better, but a more productive person.\u201d\n\nUltra Mono was recorded throughout 2019 and the band documented the process, intermittently sharing images of themselves on social media in the studio throughout the year, with one post teasing an appearance from Warren Ellis. In an interview with Zane Lowe in December 2019, Talbot confirmed that they had finished recording the album and that it was being mixed. The band worked with returning Joy producers Nick Launay and Adam \u2018Atom\u2019 Greenspan on the album, with additional programming provided by Kenny Beats and additional guest appearances from Jehnny Beth, David Yow and Jamie Cullum.\n\nRelease and promotion \nOn 19 May 2020, Idles released \"Mr. Motivator\" as a promotional single from the album. This was preceded by a light-hearted post on the band's Instagram account on 15 May which invited their audience to \"get physical with Dev,\" featuring bassist Adam Devonshire working out and quoting lyrics from the song. In keeping with the announcement's theme, the song's music video featured a montage of fan-submitted workout clips.\n\nOn 16 June 2020, Joe Talbot announced Ultra Mono and its release date on Steve Lamacq\u2019s Radio 6 show, alongside the premiere of its lead single \"Grounds\". Following this, the band released a further two singles, \"A Hymn\" and \"Model Village\" on 14 July 2020 and 11 August 2020 respectively. A fifth single, \"Reigns\", was initially scheduled to be released on 8 September. However, a poll was conducted by a member of the band's management in the Facebook fan group, the \"AF Gang\", asking whether fans wanted to hear the new song or wait for the album. Ultimately, it was decided that the band would not release any more tracks ahead of the album, with the song's music video eventually being released on 12 January 2021.\n\nOn 24 August 2020, the band announced an 11 date tour of the UK and Ireland in support of the album, set to take place from May to June 2021. The tour was met with huge demand, resulting in a further 6 dates being added, though these dates were later postponed to January 2022 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to this, the band performed three \"Lock-In\" sets at Abbey Road Studios which were livestreamed on 29 and 30 August 2020, during which they played new material from the upcoming album, as well as songs from previous albums Joy and Brutalism and covers of songs by The Beatles, The Strokes and Ramones. On 21 September 2020, the band announced plans for a tour of intimate instore performances in support of the album across the UK beginning in April 2021, which was later pushed back to September 2021.\n\nUltra Mono was released on 25 September 2020, accompanied by the music video for \"War\", the opening track on the album. Following the album's release, \"Kill Them With Kindness\" was released as a single alongside its music video on 3 December 2020.\n\nReception \n\nUltra Mono received generally positive reviews upon release, with Metacritic awarding the album an aggregated score of 76 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, 19 of which were positive.\n\nLouder Than Wars John Robb declared Ultra Mono to be \"the album of [Idles'] career\" in a 10 out of 10 review, praising the album's themes, Launay's production and the band's performances throughout, concluding that \"it's a wonderful record. It makes you dance, think, feel wild and gentle, sing and shout and want to change the world whilst embracing everyone you can in a physically socially distanced but mentally very socially attached kind of way.\" Jordan Bassett of NME was similarly impressed with the album, describing it as \"a breakneck ride that roars through sarcasm, defiance, compassion and controversy.\"\n\nQs Dorian Lynskey wrote that the album was \"the sound of a band becoming ever more defiantly themselves\", finding it \"more adamantly political\" and complimenting its \"bludgeoning drums, scowling bass... great, slab like riffs\" and the \"hysterical urgency\" permeating the track listing. Despite finding some of the lyrics to be crude and condescending, Lysnkey eventually stated that the record's \"strengths are inseparable from its flaws\", concluding that \"IDLES' brute-force catharsis neither requires nor rewards subtlety... they are they. Take them or leave them.\" Tom Hull said that while the early comparisons of Idles to The Clash were \"ridiculous\" as the former lacks \"both the early punk fury and the later pop knack\", the band nonetheless achieves \"a middle line, which supports today's fire and fury.\"\n\nWriting for AllMusic, Liam Martin was more reserved when appraising the album. Comparing it unfavourably to the band's previous albums, Martin stated that \"there is much to enjoy here; their raucous energy shines just as bright, but underneath the surface Ultra Mono lacks the sparkle that made their first two records truly special.\" Conversely, JR Moores was much less favourable in his review for The Quietus, criticising the lyrics and a perceived misuse of the guest musicians featured on the record, classifying it as a \"by-numbers rock plod\", before rounding out his review with \"three albums in and the hype has died down. The ideas are drying up. The lack of substance is wholly exposed.\" Jazz Monroe also criticised the album in a review for Pitchfork, claiming \"Ultra Mono charges into the discourse like a hobbyist at a rally. It\u2019s not listening, just shouting. Not radical but restless. Not bad, just unnecessary.\"\n\nYear-end lists\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel \nCredits adapted from liner notes.\n\nIdles\nJoe Talbot \u2013 lead vocals\nAdam Devonshire \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals\nMark Bowen \u2013 lead guitar, production \nJon Beavis \u2013 drums\nLee Kiernan \u2013 rhythm guitar\n\nAdditional musicians\nKenny Beats \u2013 programming\nJehnny Beth \u2013 vocals (track 7)\nJamie Cullum \u2013 piano (track 5)\nWarren Ellis \u2013 backing vocals (track 2)\nColin Webster \u2013 saxophone (tracks 1-3, 9-10)\nDavid Yow \u2013 backing vocals (tracks 1, 4, 10)\n\nProduction\nAdam Greenspan \u2013 production, engineering, mixing\nNick Launay \u2013 production, engineering, mixing\nBernie Grundman \u2013 mastering\n\nAdditional personnel\nAndrew Bourne \u2013 logo\nTom Ham \u2013 photography\nRussell Oliver \u2013 artwork (painting)\nNigel Talbot \u2013 artwork (sculpture)\n\nCharts\n\nReferences\n\n2020 albums\nIdles (band) albums\nPartisan Records albums"}

{"eng_Latn":"Casilda Iturrizar (1818 \u2013 22 February 1900), also known as the Epalza widow, was a Spanish philanthropist and businessperson from Bilbao in the Basque Country. Iturrizar sought to help the most disadvantaged members of Bilbao society using her fortune for charity. The street where she lived, a hospital wing, and a city park were named after her.\n\nBiography \nCasilda Margarita de Iturrizar y Urquijo was born in Bilbao, Spain. Her father, Jos\u00e9 Ylari\u00f3n Iturrizar Basabe, was a merchant (b. 1799) and her mother was Eugenia Nicolasa Urquijo Ziurtegaray (or Siurtegaray). In 1833, after her father's death, Iturrizar joined the domestic staff serving one of the most prosperous merchants in Bilbao, Tom\u00e1s Jos\u00e9 de Epalza (1798-1873), whom Iturrizar would later marry.\n\nEpalza initiated divorce proceedings from his first wife in 1849 and the businessman was granted an ecclesiastical divorce, but it came without an annulment of the marriage, so officially, he remained married to his first wife until she died in 1857.\n\nMarriage \nIturrizar and Epalza finally married in 1859. By that time, Epalza was making his fortune as one of the founders of Banco de Bilbao (1857), along with his cousins Pablo de Epalza Lecanda and Domingo de Epalza Larraondo. His other financial positions were many, including the Bilbao-Tudela Railway as well as the first modern steel company in the Basque Country.\n\nAfter her husband died in 1873, Iturrizar took on the financial management of his assets. While she relinquished some of his holdings, she stayed involved with \"banks and real estate, in addition to investing in railways (such as the Central de Vizcaya, the Bilbao to Portugalete or La Robla) or in coal mining (Hulleras de Sabero and Annexes).\" She became the richest woman in Bibao after her husband's death.\n\nPhilanthropy \n\nIturrizar financed the construction of the Tivoli schools, later named in her honor, collaborated with the Bilbao Choral Society and created scholarships for outstanding students from the city's public schools. She also contributed to many Catholic organizations such as the Claretians of the San Francisco neighborhood, the Servants of Jesus de La Naja and the Augustinians of Portugalete.\n\nShe also invested in the Anonymous Society of the Bilbao New Theater, formed in 1885 and which built the Teatro Arriaga in 1890.\n\nShe also joined the Catholic Foundation of Schools and Workers' Board of Trustees in 1891 to advance its goal of offering \"completely free teaching, moralization, recreation and protection to the working class.\"\n\nDeath\nIturrizar died in Bilbao, on 22 February 1900.\n\nShe had no children or direct descendants so 7.5 million pesetas of her fortune (which did not represent the full amount), was bequeathed to many social organizations after her death, including the Casa de Misericordia and the Civil Hospital. After her death, Iturrizar bequeathed her income to a scholarship fund for Bilbao public schools which was started in 1902 and still operates.\n\nMemorials \nIn Bilbao's large Do\u00f1a Casilda Iturrizar Park, named for her and located near the city center, there is a monument to Iturrizar created by the Catalonian sculptor Agust\u00edn Querol.\n\nOne of the wings of Bilbao's Basurto Hospital was named in her honor.\n\nIturrizar is also memorialized on the Bilbao street where she lived, Viuda de Epalza, with a plaque that says (in Spanish):\"Year MCDCCCC.

Its content deals with the controversial governmental and scientific issues relating to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic in France.\n\nTheme \nIn this book, Christian Perronne criticizes the French government's management of the Covid-19 pandemic in France. He denounces a \"State lie\" regarding the shortages of masks and tests. He castigates the infringement with doctors' freedom to prescribe and what he perceives as an intensive lobbying by pharmaceutical laboratories and \u201cBig Pharma\u201d. He blames the wait-and-see attitude of the French health authorities, in particular the Scientific Council, and he points out the inability of most internal administrative structures to adequately deal with an emergency situation.\n\nCritical reviews \n\nIn the daily newspaper Les \u00c9chos, Kevin Badeau wrote that the author's point of view \u201ctoo often falls into excessive severity,\u201d adding that \u201ceverything or almost everything is a scandal\u201d. In the journal Financial Afrik, Laurent Mucchielli wrote \u201cif the form of the commentary is sometimes criticizable, the well-argued textual substance reflects a widely shared anger\u201d.\n\nMedia coverage and sales \n\nDuring the week of 22\u201328 June 2020, the book ranked twelfth in sales in France (it was first in the category \u201cTests and References\u201d).\n\nControversies on the fringes of the book's release \n\nDuring several broadcast interviews and confrontations on television and radio, he attacked various decrees whose promulgation would have contributed to the doctors of the Nantes University Hospital being confronted with no other outcome than \u201cletting his brother-in-law die\u201d due to the impossibility for them to resort to the only drug that, according to him, could have helped to get his relative off the hook if the ban on prescribing Plaquenil had not been pronounced in high places, thus leaving the health care system destitute and \u201cstark naked\u201d in the face of the pandemic. He further states that \u201cFrance is the only country in the world where doctors have been banned from prescribing chloroquine\u201d. He therefore estimates that the treatment using this medication, if it had not been so arbitrarily banned, could have helped save the lives of 25,000 people.

{"eng_Latn":"Cantate! (Sing!) is a German Catholic hymnal first published in 1847, and continued in seven editions until 1879. It was a collection of 444 old and new songs, edited by the educator and hymnwriter Heinrich Bone, and the first Catholic hymnal in German that was used in multiple dioceses. Several of the songs are still part of the common Catholic hymnal in German, Gotteslob.\n\nHistory \nHeinrich Bone published the hymnal Cantate! (Sing!), a collection of 444 songs, which appeared between 1847 and 1879 in seven editions. It was the first Catholic hymnal which was used in multiple German-speaking dioceses. A book with melodies for the songs appeared in 1852.\n\nProgram \nThe hymnal has a programmatic title in Latin, referring to the traditional language in the Catholic Church. It is subtitled \"Katholisches Gesangbuch nebst Gebeten und Andachten f\u00fcr alle Zeiten und Feste des Kirchenjahres\" (Catholic songbook including prayers and contemplations for all times and feasts of the church year). Bone published traditional Latin hymns as the basis for singing in church, and also translated medieval and Baroque texts to a contemporary language, such as \"Komm, Sch\u00f6pfer Geist, kehr bei uns ein\" as a paraphrase of the 9th-century Veni Creator Spiritus, to make the return of traditional hymns to Catholic services possible. It also contained new hymns.\n\nFor the second, expanded edition of 1851, Bone wrote a foreword of several pages explaining his program, dated Christmas 1850. It is followed by an alphabetic index of the songs, first the songs in German, then those in Latin. A list of prayers and contemplations is followed by a list of the feasts, naming a saint for each day of the year. The songs begin with Latin hymns, listed with parallel German versions. The section with songs in German follows the liturgical year, beginning with Advent. Hymns often refer to original Latin hymns.\n\nGotteslob \nThe common German hymnal Gotteslob of 1975 contained several songs from Bone's Cantate!, some with revised wording. Some were included in its second edition of 2013, and some also in the Protestant hymnal EG. In the following list, the GL number refers to the 2013 edition, with the former number in brackets.\n GL 222 (112) \"Herr, send herab uns deinen Sohn\" for Advent, after Veni, veni, Emmanuel\n GL 258 (158) \"Lobpreiset all zu dieser Zeit\" for New Year's Day, also EG 550 (West), first two stanzas\n GL 329 (220) \"Das ist der Tag, den Gott gemacht\" for Easter, stanzas 1,2,5\n GL 351 (245) \"Komm, Sch\u00f6pfer Geist, kehr bei uns ein\" for Pentecost, after Veni Creator Spiritus\n GL 142 (462) \"Zu dir, o Gott, erheben wir\", for the beginning of a service\n GL 532 (584) \"Christi Mutter stand mit Schmerzen\", a paraphrase of the Stabat mater\n GL 522 (587) \"Maria aufgenommen ist\" for Assumption of Mary\n GL 526 (589) \"\", a paraphrase of \"Omni die dic Mariae\"\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography \n\n \n\n \n\nCatholic Church in Germany\nCatholic hymnals\n1847 books"}

{"eng_Latn":"The States of Jersey Ambulance Service (SJAS) is managed by the Justice and Home Affairs department.\n\nIn 2022 in order to deal with peaks in demand and unexpected events it changed the way emergency calls were prioritised.  Staff shortages were attributed to the cost of living on the island and it was suggested that there could be accommodation provided for the ambulance staff.  Calls will be prioritised similarly to practice in NHS ambulance services.\n\nIt launched a community first responders scheme in 2022.\n\nPerformance\nThe service was said to be a good organisation with \"passionate and caring staff who provide a good quality of care to patients\" when reviewed in 2022 but levels of staff were said to be inadequate in terms of meeting current demands. An overspend of around \u00a3400,000 was expected by the end of 2022. A lack of core capacity leads more agency staff being used and for staff doing more overtime.\n\nStructure\nThe SJAS is structured similarly to most NHS ambulance services.\n\nParamedics are the primary healthcare professionals within the service and are all required to be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council, like in the UK. There are currently no on-island routes to becoming a paramedic, as paramedics require a Paramedic Science BSc (Hons) to become registered.  \n\nParamedics are supported by ambulance technicians who are also healthcare professionals however lack the same scope of practice and autonomy as their paramedic colleagues. Ambulance technicians can be trained on-island by the service. Where a lack of paramedic staff on duty makes it necessary, technicians may crew together on front line ambulances.\n\nThe SJAS has recently introduced a new clinical role known as an emergency care assistant (ECA). ECAs have the most basic scope of practice for front line ambulance staff and work in a supporting capacity to paramedics. ECAs can never crew together to operate a front line ambulance.\n\nAll of the above staff crew between two and four double crewed ambulances dependant on staffing and time of day. Where there is an odd-number of staff, paramedics may work on a see-and-treat vehicle, targeted at delivering care to patients who may be discharged into the community and not require transport to hospital. The see-and-treat vehicle is sometimes used for paramedic backup or as an additional resource to life-threatening emergencies.\n\nThe service also operates an intermediary crew, which has the primary role of providing inter-facility transfers. This is broadly 'take-homes' between Jersey General Hospital and discharged patients' homes but may also involve transport to and from Jersey Airport. Patients may be taken to Jersey Airport where they require specialist care which cannot be provided at Jersey General Hospital and instead will be flown via the Jersey Emergency Transfer Service (JETS) to the UK to a more specialised hospital. Staff that crew the intermediary ambulance are trained to FREC-3 or FREC-4 levels and are only ever crewed on front line ambulances when a lack of staffing makes it necessary.\n\nParamedics can progress to work as 'leading ambulance paramedics' (LAPs) who are bronze commanders for the service. LAP is a hybrid role of office-based and operational work. The LAP will be dispatched by the Combined Control Centre (CCC) to support ambulance crews at challenging or multi-agency scenes in a managerial or clinical capacity. LAPs are also deployable to emergencies where all other paramedic crews are unavailable.\n\nLAPs are supported by a Silver Duty Officer (SDO) who are deployable from office work to multiagency incidents, major incidents and to emergencies where all other paramedic crews and the LAP are unavailable.\n\nFleet\nThe SJAS has thirteen vehicles in its fleet.  \n\n 7 emergency ambulances\n 2 rapid response cars\n 1 see and treat vehicle\n 1 intermediary crew ambulance\n 2 major incident vehicles\n\nThe SJAS also operates patient transport services which use ten minibuses.  Front line ambulances are Mercedes Sprinter box-conversions\n\nSignificant events\nMost notably, the SJAS responded to the Haut du Mont flat explosion on 10 December 2022 where ten people were killed.  In attendance were three front line ambulances, two major incident support vehicles, the duty leading ambulance paramedic and the silver duty officer as well as volunteer ambulance agencies such as St John Ambulance Jersey and the Ambulance Support Unit (ASU).\n\nReferences\n\nOrganisations based in Jersey\nEmergency services in Jersey\nAmbulance services in the United Kingdom"}
{"eng_Latn":"Action for the Republic (, AxR) is a Catalan nationalist and progressive political party in Catalonia, founded by independent deputies of the Parliament of Catalonia grouped into the Together for the Republic (, JuntsxRep) internal current within the Together for Catalonia (JxCat) alliance. The party defines itself ideologically as independentist, republican, ecologist, feminist and progressive, and has the Dutch Democrats 66 party as its ideological referent. It advocates for a \"broad republican and patriotic front\" together with other pro-independence parties while supporting \"a policy of rupture\".\n\nNotable party members include former Catalan minister and city councillor in Barcelona Ferran Mascarell and historian Agust\u00ed Colomines.\n\nHistory\nThe party has its roots in the \"Together for the Republic\" () internal current within the Together for Catalonia (JxCat) parliamentary group in the Parliament of Catalonia, which had been established in March 2018 by unaligned deputies Elsa Artadi, Eduard Pujol, Josep Riera, Aurora Madaula and Antoni Morral. Among the current's political initiatives was a proposal in March 2019 for both JxCat and Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) to form a single, unitary parliamentary group in both chambers of the Cortes Generales.\n\nThe transformation of the Together for the Republic current into a political party was announced on 25 July 2019, with its founding process starting in November 2019. The party has explicitly rejected the reorganization of the post-Democratic Convergence of Catalonia's space around the Catalan European Democratic Party (PDeCAT), instead defending former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont's \"legitimacy\" to take over the leadership of the Catalan pro-independence cause, with many AxR members having also joined Puigdemont's National Call for the Republic (CNxR). On 1 July 2020, AxR advocated for the JxCat alliance to be transformed into a platform comprising the CNxR, independent collectives as well as itself, just hours before Puigdemont's announcement of a new political party to be publicly presented on 25 July.\n\nOn 19 July 2020, AxR held an extraordinary assembly where it voted in favour of urging party members to \"individually\" join Puigdemont's new Together for Catalonia and \"actively participate in the process of constituting the new party\".\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n2019 establishments in Catalonia\nCatalan nationalist parties\nPolitical parties established in 2019\nPolitical parties in Catalonia"}

{"eng_Latn":"Joan Mary Crossley-Holland  ( Cowper; 3 April 1912 \u2013 12 January 2005) was an English gallery owner and potter. Educated at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, she began a career in pottery at Royal Doulton. She took a break from work to raise her children. Therefore, Crossley-Holland was employed as a personal assistant to the Maharana of Mewar at the Lake Palace Hotel for a year. She was appointed director of Oxford's Bear Lane Gallery in 1966 but left to establish the independent Oxford Gallery in 1968 after disagreements with trustees over whether pottery was considered art. Crossley-Holland oversaw 186 exhibitions from artists by the time she retired in 1986.\n\nEarly life\nCrossley-Holland was born Joan Cowper at Peatling Magna, Lutterworth, Leicestershire on 3 April 1912, to the medical doctor Claude Marriott Lovell Cowper and the nurse and amateur artist Mary Bourne, n\u00e9e Collard. An only child, she was raised in Leicestershire and Buckinghamshire, where her father practiced his profession in Leighton Buzzard. Crossley-Holland was first taught at Plymouth Brethren Boys' School, Northfield, where she captained the first XI football team. She was later educated at Wycombe Abbey, where she learnt pottery and science. From 1931 to 1934, Crossley-Holland attended London's Central School of Arts and Crafts, taking a course in pottery. Studying opposite Dora Billington, the course gave her a life long fascination of pottery, and according to Geoffrey Findlay of The Guardian, contributed \"to the general revival of the arts and crafts movement in Britain in those interwar years.\"\n\nCareer\nFollowing the completion of her course at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, Crossley-Holland went back to Leicestershire to do her own pottery work in an independent studio. In 1936, she was offered employment as a designer at Royal Doulton in Lambeth, where she remained until 1939, where she made full-bodied rough textured pots that were praised by connoisseurs for its \"simplicity and modernity\", and exhibited at Heal's and Liberty and Peter Jones. When the Second World War broke out, Crossley-Holland resigned her career to become a housewife after she got married and raised her children for the following two decades in Buckinghamshire and later Hampstead. She also worked for the Social Survey.\n\nThrough a mutual friend in the early 1960s, Crossley-Holland was offered the opportunity to work as a personal assistant to the Maharana of Mewar at the Lake Palace Hotel, Udaipur for a year. She returned to the United Kingdom in the mid-1960s, and was appointed director of the Arts Council-sponsored Bear Lane Gallery, Oxford in 1966. Crossley-Holland often disagreed with the gallery's trustees if pottery was considered art when she argued an exhibition of craftsmanship would be best suited to fill a gap in their schedule. With the intention of \"if you can't join them, beat them\", after she was given the response \"What? Not casseroles?\" by the trustees, she obtained the financial backing of 29 personal friends as shareholders and set-up the Oxford Gallery on High Street, Oxford in 1968.\n\nAs one of the first specially commercial craft and art galleries for this purpose, the Oxford Gallery under Crossley-Holland's leadership hosted 187 exhibitions involving more than 2,000 artists at the rate of one every five weeks with works of fine art such as prints, glass, pottery, engraving, jewellery, wall-hanging and the occasional painting put on display. She was one of the first to put on exhibits of John Makepeace's furniture, Lucie Rie's and Hans Coper's pottery, Wendy Ramshaw's jewellery and Peter Collingwood's weaving. Throughout the 1970s and earliy 1980s, Crossley-Holland was in a partnership with the Bradford Print Biennale, and received enough capital from garden exhibitions designed by Harold Peto in the High Walls in Headington in 1984 and 1985. She retired from the Oxford Gallery in 1986 and moved to Walsham le Willows, Suffolk. A special indoor\/outdoor exhibition in honour of Crossley-Holland ran at the Barbican Conservatory in early 1986.\n\nPersonal life\nFrom 10 September 1939 to 1970, she was married to the composer Peter Crossley-Holland. They had two children, Kevin Crossley-Holland, who became a children's author and poet, and Sally.

She died from Alzheimer's disease at Pinford End House nursing home, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk on 12 January 2005.\n\nPersonality and legacy \nMarina Vaizey described Crossley-Holland as \"small, bustling, and determined, rather like a fictionalised version of an inspiring but at times overwhelming sixth-form teacher\" who had an \"old-fashioned\" appearance. She also noted her \"preference for subdued colours from sludge green to rust red\" and for sporting \"the unexpected piece of avant garde jewellery.\"\n\nUpon her retirement, the director of the Crafts Council Victor Margie labelled her a \"crusader and missionary\", and spoke of her \"dogged persistence of a remarkable woman who chose to dedicate her working life to a better understanding of the visual arts. She has earned the respect of those of us working in the crafts.\" The obituarist for The Independent said Crossley-Holland and her colleagues \" quite simply changed the map of craft in Britain in the second half of the 20th century.\"\n\nReferences\n\n1912 births\n2005 deaths\nPeople from Lutterworth\nPeople educated at Wycombe Abbey\nAlumni of the Central School of Art and Design\n20th-century English women\n20th-century English people\n21st-century English women\n21st-century English people\nEnglish women artists\nEnglish potters\nEnglish art dealers\nWomen art dealers\nMembers of the Order of the British Empire\nDeaths from dementia in England\nDeaths from Alzheimer's disease\n20th-century English businesspeople"}

{"eng_Latn":"Bohdan Oleksandrovych Kistyakivsky (; 16 November 1869 \u2013 16 April 1920) was a Ukrainian philosopher, jurist, and sociologist. He reached prominence with his Gesellschaft und Einzelwesen (Society and Individuals) published in Berlin in 1899. Philosophically he defended transcendental idealism. In 1902 he contributed to Problems of Idealism (Problemy Idealizma), edited by Pavel Novgorodtsev. In 1909 he contributed the essay \"In Defense of Law\" to the anthology Vekhi (Landmarks).\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life \nBohdan Kistyakivsky was born in Kyiv, Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire on 16 November 1869. His father, Oleksandr Fedorovych Kistyakivsky, was a professor of criminal law at the University of Kyiv and the president of the Legal Society of Kyiv. \n\nKistyakivsky later remarked that he felt he had always struggled for his Ukrainian national identity and that he had been 'Russianized'.\n\nEducation \nBetween 1888 and 1892, Kistyakivsky was expelled from the history and philology departments of the University of Kyiv and the University of Kharkiv, as well as the law school of the University of Dorpat due to his participation in underground Ukrainian nationalist groups. \n\nHe was arrested in connection to nationalist groups in 1892, and when he was released in 1895, Kistyakivsky decided to continue his studies abroad. He attended the University of Berlin, the Sorbonne, and the University of Strasbourg. In 1898, he defended a philosophy doctoral dissertation entitled 'On Society and the Individual', which was published in Berlin the following year and received acclaim from German thinkers.\n\nFamily \nKistyakivsky married Maria Vilyamovna Kistakovskaya (n\u00e9e Berenshtam) (Russian: \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0412\u0438\u043b\u044c\u044f\u043c\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f), who taught at workers' schools in St. Petersburg with Nadezhda Krupskaya. They had two sons: the American chemist George Kistiakowsky, and the Ukrainian ornithologist Oleksandr Kistyakivsky.\n\nPhilosophy and Law career \nUpon return to Russia, Kistyakivsky became a lecturer in state and administrative law at the Moscow Commercial Institute and later worked at the University of Moscow and in Yaroslavl. His writings were influenced by leading German thinkers, notably neo-Kantian philosophers and Georg Jellinek. He was a friend of Max Weber, whose views on the need for reform in Russian politics he shared.\n\nIn 1902, he contributed an article to the Problems of Idealism (Problemy Idealizma) (Russian: \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u044b \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430) on the revival of natural law doctrine. The ideas expressed in the collection were critical of the core beliefs of the radical intelligentsia, but they were expressed in a sufficiently academic way so as not to cause controversy. It included essays criticizing the historical theories of Marx and Engels and critiques of Comte and Mikhaylovsky. \n\nIn 1905, Kistyakivsky published an article in the first issue of the literary-social journal Voprosy zhizni, which was edited by Nikolai Losskii. The article called for the recognition of the significance of the individual and their rights and argued that civil rights are absolute and inalienable. \n\nIn 1909, Kistyakivsky contributed an article entitled 'In Defense of Law: The Intelligentsia and Legal Consciousness' to Vekhi. The article argued that the intelligentsia have no interest in the law and no legal consciousness. He criticizes the intelligentsia for ignoring the idea of 'intuitive law' and viewing legal systems as only something external. He also directly connected the lack of legal consciousness to the intelligentsia's rejection of a constitutional system, which he argues is the only system of government that can guarantee freedom and individual rights. \n\nThrough his writings, Kistyakivsky became a leading advocate of constitutionalism in Russia. His principal work, Social Science and Law (1916), attempted to establish a theory of law in the context of the social sciences, through a critical analysis of the principal schools of legal theory of his time.\n\nIn 1917, he became a professor at the University of Kyiv and also was involved in organising the Ukrainian Federal Democratic Party. In 1919, he was elected a full member of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Kistyakivsky fell ill traveling in 1919 and died in Yekaterinodar in 1920.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n \n\n1869 births\n1920 deaths\nUkrainian philosophers\nNational University of Kharkiv alumni\nAcademic staff of the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv"}

His older brother, Frederick Watts, was President Ulysses S.

Watts presented credentials to Emperor Franz Joseph I on September 25, 1868, serving until his mission was terminated and he presented recall on June 1, 1869. After leaving his post, he visited Russia, Poland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and other European countries.\n\nAfter returning to the United States, he was engaged in the development of the iron and coal interests in Pennsylvania.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1838, Watts was married to Anna Maria Shoenberger (1818\u20131888), a daughter of Sarah (n\u00e9e Krug) Shoenberger and Dr. Peter Shoenberger of Pittsburgh, who built the Juniata Iron Mill and what became the Shoenberger Steel Company.

Upon their arrival, they are pleased to see that the town looks deserted. When they enter the house, Emily and Randall go upstairs and have sex and then have a small disagreement. They soon learn that another couple is already staying at the beach house\u2014Mitch and Jane Turner, old friends of Randall's father. Jane is terminally ill, and Mitch hopes to give her one last happy vacation. Because the house has plenty of room, both couples decide to stay.\n\nAfter dinner, Randall suggests they all share some edible marijuana which he brought with him, to which Jane and Mitch agree. While high, Mitch notices the strange water texture, and they all see glowing microbes covering the beach and trees. Jane leaves to see it up close but starts coughing after a while and gets disoriented when a strong fog starts to form around the area. After breathing in the fog, Emily becomes disoriented as well and passes out. She awakens to a sick Jane throwing up and goes to sleep. When she wakes up the next day, she finds a catatonic Jane sitting in the kitchen, covered in skin lesions, and Mitch missing.\n\nRandall and Emily decide to go to the beach, which they are surprised to find is completely empty. After a while, Randall gets sick to the stomach and rushes back to the house. In the bathroom, he sees the water from the sink forming strange patterns; then, hearing Jane moan, he goes to help her. On the beach, Mitch suddenly appears. He muses that something about the area feels off, then tells Emily he is going for a swim; instead, he drowns himself. Panicked Emily steps on a washed up jellyfish. It stings her and Emily sees a worm-like creature crawling in an open wound. She manages to crawl up to the house and remove the worm. She finds a sickened Randall being pursued by Jane, who has milky white eyes and strange fluid leaking from her mouth. Managing to lock Jane in the house, Randall and Emily escape into the slowly thickening fog.\n\nBy nightfall, the fog covers the area and Randall has become even sicker. Emily discovers a police car with a radio inside, and she manages to contact someone. The person on the other end asks if \"they have been exposed\" and tells them to barricade themselves and to not breathe in the fog. They break into a house for shelter. They find that the water is now a completely different texture. When Emily turns on the TV she finds an Emergency Alert System on every channel and a radio broadcast reveals that the microbes, which were preserved in underwater rocks, had been released by global warming. Emily suggests they wait until morning, but Randall is scared of dying. Emily goes into the basement, finds oxygen tanks for scuba diving, and concludes they can use them to breathe in safe air. She also discovers a horribly mutated person feeding on a corpse.\n\nUpstairs, she discovers Randall has succumbed to the infection and kills him. Finding the keys to a car, she drives away but becomes disoriented in the fog and crashes into a tree. She stumbles from the car into a puddle and lies there, breathing in the fog and hallucinating about the microbes in the water. The next morning, she lies on the beach, telling herself not to be scared as the infection completes its course. A wave engulfs her body, dragging her out to sea.\n\nCast\n Liana Liberato as Emily\n Noah Le Gros as Randall\n Maryann Nagel as Jane\n Jake Weber as Mitch\n\nMusic\nThe film's score was composed by British electronic musician Roly Porter.

Brown. He crafts a slick tale of invasion and destruction that's both intimate and cosmically grand.\"\n\nMichael Gingold of Rue Morgue wrote that, \"With a modest budget and scope, Brown nonetheless elicits a sense of engulfing biological apocalypse\". Varietys Dennis Harvey commended the film for its tone and \"generally strong performances\", calling it \"skillful enough to satisfy most viewers, if not quite sufficiently original in concept or striking in execution to leave a lasting imprint.\" Henry Stewart of Slant Magazine gave the film two out of four stars, criticizing its characterization: \"The character drama becomes afterthought as it's superseded by action.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n\n2019 films\n2019 horror films\nAmerican science fiction horror films\nFilms about vacationing\nFilms about viral outbreaks\nFilms set on beaches\n2019 directorial debut films\n2010s English-language films\n2010s American films"}

A submarine-style pitcher, he played 16 seasons in the KBO League, mostly for the Haitai\/Kia Tigers. He is second all-time in the KBO League in career strikeouts and third in career victories. Lee was one of the top KBO pitchers of the 1990s, and is the only pitcher from that league to have won 10+ games in ten consecutive seasons, which he did from 1989 to 1998.\n\nPlaying career \nBorn in Gwangju, Lee attended Gwangju Jeil High School and Dongguk University. He pitched for the South Korea national baseball team in the 1988 Baseball World Cup and also in the 1988 Summer Olympics.\n\nLee debuted with the Haitai Tigers in 1989 at age 23 and had an immediate impact, going 15\u20138 with a 3.23 earned run average as the Tigers won the Korean Series. (During his career, Lee would win four more KBO championships with the Tigers.)\n\nLee went 18\u20139 in 1992, with 155 strikeouts, enough to lead the KBO that year.\n\nHe was the Most Valuable Player of the 1996 Korean Series, which the Tigers won 4-games-to-2 over the Hyundai Unicorns.

She and Maneka Gandhi were asking for the posters to be removed. They reiterated the advice from the World Health Organization that this fear was unfounded. Later she and the SPCA group took on the role of organising the welfare of horses. The horses were used to give tourists rides but the lockdown meant that these unlicensed horses were not taking any money. Without any income the owners could not feed them and the SPCA helped.\n\nReferences\n\nLiving people\n1960s births"}

{"eng_Latn":"The Map of C\u00e9spedes Xeria ( or Map of the Ayemb\u00ed y del Paran\u00e1 River, with its tributaries, which used Luis de C\u00e9spedes Jer\u00eda, governor of Paraguay, to enter into the jurisdiction from Brazil, ) is a map produced by Dom Luis de C\u00e9spedes Garc\u00eda Xer\u00eda, a 17th-century Spanish military officer. The map is dated November 8, 1628. It depicts the path that Xeria traveled between the village of S\u00e3o Paulo de Piratininga, now the modern city of S\u00e3o Paulo, to Ciudad Real de Guayr\u00e1, Province of Paraguay. Ciudad Real de Guayr\u00e1 was a Spanish-held city in the present-day Brazilian state of Paran\u00e1. Xeria travelled using the Tiet\u00ea and Paran\u00e1 rivers from July 16 to September 18, 1628. The dimensions of the Map of C\u00e9spedes Xeria are  x . The Map of C\u00e9spedes Xeria is the first known of the interior of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo and the first to establish a cartographic representation the wider Southeast region of Brazil. It additionally provides the earliest representations of the Tiet\u00ea and Paran\u00e1 rivers.\n\nThe Museu do Ipiranga (commonly known as the Paulista Museum) acquired a facsimile copy of the map in 1917. The Map of C\u00e9spedes Xeria established a historical narrative of the S\u00e3o Paulo region in the 20th century; it additionally aided in the interpretation of the development of the territory of what would be the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. Images of the map have subsequently appeared in a large range of textbooks, book covers, magazine covers, and other publications related to the history of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nLuis de C\u00e9spedes Garc\u00eda Xeria\n\nLittle is known about Luis de C\u00e9spedes Garc\u00eda Xer\u00eda. He lived in the 17th century, and arrived in present-day Brazil to administer the Spanish colony of Paraguay. He sent an account to Philip of Spain on the arrival of 43 Dutch ships in Bahia and Esp\u00edrito Santo on July 30, 1627, along with a description of damage caused by the attempted invasion. The event occurred after two conflicts between the Dutch and Spanish-Portuguese forces: the Capture of Bahia in 1624 and Recapture of Bahia in 1625. The Map of C\u00e9spedes Xeria is dated 1628, shortly before the establishingment of Dutch Brazil.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Map of C\u00e9spedes Xeria was produced to accompany a letter from C\u00e9spedes Xer\u00eda to King Philip IV of Spain (also styled as King Philip III of Portugal). It was likely a report of the route of Tiet\u00ea (denominated the R\u00edo Ayemb\u00ed on the map) and Paran\u00e1 rivers to facilitate the formation of foreign policy of Philip IV. Xeria's route is represented by a red line on the map. It is accompanied by illustrations of cities, towns, and indigenous villages. Nature is poorly represented in the map, other than river banks and some islands. The map lacks reliable coordinates, a compass rose, an indication of north orientation, projections, scale, or geometric precision.\n\nThe Tiet\u00ea River is represented in the upper left quadrants of the map, together with Vila de S\u00e3o Paulo. The Paran\u00e1 River appears in the lower left quadrants of the documents; the settlements are in the lower right quadrants. The legend is in three columns and the crosses along the route to represent landing sites.\n\nVersions\n\nThere are two versions of the map: the first is called Map 17 of C\u00e9spedes Xeria () and a second is titles Mapa 17bis de C\u00e9spedes Xeria. Both are from the General Archive of the Indies in Seville, Spain. Although C\u00e9spedes Xeria was a military officer, studies show that he both collected the data and made the drawing. His intention was to send the map directly to Philip of Spain with his letter written in his own hand. Xeria, however, used copyists to produce reproductions of the document; this explains the difference of handwriting between the two versions.\n\nFacsimile at the Museu Paulista\n\nAfonso d'Escragnolle Taunay (1876-1958), historian and director of the Museu Paulista between 1917 and 1946, located the map during the research he carried out at the museum. He had a great interest in the early history of Brazil, and his research focused on the role of the S\u00e3o Paulo region in the formation of the colony of Brazil. Taunay sought to situate the central role of S\u00e3o Paulo in the Independence of Brazil in conjunction of the centenary of the event in 1922.\n\nTaunay discovered the map in 1917, the year he became director of the museum. During this period, he made several structural changes to the institution, primarily to transform it into a historical museum. He inaugurated a room dedicated solely to the history of Brazil and S\u00e3o Paulo, colonial-period cartography, and a display of archival documents. The room is known as \"Sala A-10\"; maps are prominently displayed to highlight the chronology of Brazilian history. Taunay exchanged archival documents and ordered facsimiles from different institutions from around the world to set up Sala A-10. The Map of C\u00e9spedes Xeria was of primary importance to Taunay, and he sought to obtain a copy from the General Archive of the Indies in Seville.\n\nThe facsimile of C\u00e9spedes Xeria's map was produced by the copyist Santiago Montero D\u00edaz. D\u00edaz, a copyist with extensive experience with works in the collection of the General Archive in Seville, utilized both versions of the map in the archive: Map 17 of C\u00e9spedes Xeria and Map 17bis of C\u00e9spedes Xeria. He additionally copied letters from C\u00e9spedes Xeria to Philip of Spain. Montero D\u00edaz finished work on the facsimile in October 1917 and charge 200 pesetas (178 thousand r\u00e9is) for the work. Taunay inaugurated Sala A-10 after receipt of the facsimile copy of the map and displayed it in a prominent place in the room. It was framed and displayed with its related documentation, also in facsimile format. Taunay used the map for articles published in Correio Paulistano, the Revista do Instituto Hist\u00f3rico e Geogr\u00e1fico Brasileiro, and the Annals of the Paulista Museum.\n\nAccuracy and authenticity\n\nDiscussion about the faithfulness of the facsimile produced by Santiago Montero D\u00edaz began in the late 20th century. Correspondence and comparative analyses between the original map and the facsimile demonstrate that Taunay was unaware that Montero D\u00edaz used two versions of the map to produce the facsimile. However, the facsimile has few differences from the original versions or related documents.\n\nReferences\n\nHistoric maps of the Americas\n17th-century maps and globes\n1620s in Brazil\nColonial Paraguay"}

{"eng_Latn":"The Black Country UNESCO Global Geopark is a geopark in the Black Country, a part of the West Midlands region of England. Having previously been an \u2018aspiring Geopark\u2019, it was awarded UNESCO Global Geopark status on 10 July 2020.\n\nGeology\nThe Geopark extends across territory underlain by sedimentary rocks of Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian and Triassic age together with some limited outcrops of igneous rocks. Coal, ironstone, limestone, fireclay, brick clay and building stones have all been exploited in the area in the last few centuries. Evidence is also present for the margins of both the Anglian icesheet and the Devensian icesheet.\n\nSilurian rocks\nThe oldest rocks which outcrop at the surface within the Geopark are the early Silurian shales and limestones which are seen in a series of faulted and folded inliers between Lye in the south and Ettingshall Park in the north. There is a further area of Silurian rocks exposed between Walsall, Gravelly Hill Interchange and Aldridge. The sequence locally (in stratigraphic order i.e. uppermost\/youngest, at top):\n\nRaglan Mudstone Formation (mudstone and siltstone)\nTemeside Mudstone Formation (mudstone, siltstone and sandstone)\nDownton Castle Sandstone Formation\nWhitcliffe Formation (siltstone\/mudstone\/limestone, formerly Upper Ludlow Shales)\nAymestry Limestone Formation (limestone\/mudstone)\nLower Ludlow Shales Group\nMuch Wenlock Limestone Formation (comprises three sub-units; Lower Quarried Limestone Member, the Nodular Limestone Member and the Upper Quarried Limestone member each of which comprises both limestone and mudstone)\nCoalbrookdale Formation (green-grey mudstones, formerly known as the Grey or Wenlock shales)\nBarr Limestone Formation (grey limestone, mudstone)\n\nThe Barr Limestone is of Sheinwoodian age (433-430.5 Ma (million years ago)), the Much Wenlock Limestone of Homerian age (430.5-427 Ma) with the Coalbrookdale Formation being transitional between the two: all three formations are of Wenlockian age (c.433-427 Ma). The youngest three of the Silurian formations dates from the Pridoli epoch (423-419 Ma), towards the end of the period, and are regarded as the lowest\/earliest part of the Old Red Sandstone succession in this region. The Much Wenlock limestones were extensively quarried at the Wren's Nest inlier. Dudley Castle is built upon a neighbouring inlier.\n\nDevonian rocks\nThe Clee Sandstone Formation, which outcrops to the west and northwest of Sedgeley, originates in the Devonian period and is of Emsian age (c.408-393 Ma). The sandstone strata which dip moderately away to the northwest, form a part of the Old Red Sandstone succession. These rocks may be seen as outlying parts of the Anglo-Welsh Basin.\n\nCarboniferous intrusive rocks\nA series of dolerite and basalt intrusions occur within the Carboniferous sequence including the Brewin's Bridge microgabbro dyke, London Fields basalt sill and Rowley Regis microgabbro lopolith. Associated with these is a basaltic vent at Barrow Hill.\n\nGeography\nThe Geopark has been established across the entirety of the boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton. As such it encompasses a wider area than the traditional Black Country, though the boundaries of this distinctive historic urban landscape within the West Midlands are difficult to pin down firmly. Originally more than a hundred individual villages, the area was at the heart of the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth century. The name is said to derive from the blackened and scarred landscape which resulted from the intensive exploitation of its natural mineral wealth. The area overlaps the South Staffordshire coalfield.\n\nTurner's Hill near the heart of the area reaches to 271m above sea level whilst the landscape rises to the 227m high viewpoint of Barr Beacon east of Walsall and, on its southern boundary, to a height of 224m at Wychbury Hill, a northern outlier of the Clent Hills. The area drains to the River Stour to the west, the Penk to the north and eventually to the Tame to the east via numerous tributaries. It is criss-crossed by canals including the Tame Valley Canal, Rushall Canal, Wyrley and Essington Canal, Dudley Canal, Stourbridge Canal, Birmingham Canal, Shropshire Union Canal and Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal.\n\nNotable features\nIn 1956 Wren's Nest National Nature Reserve (NNR) became the first area in England to be designated as a national nature reserve for the geological interest of its bedrock, and remains a key \u2018geosite\u2019 within the modern Geopark. There are a further 16 SSSIs within the Geopark and 105 SINCs.\nThe Dudley Canal and Tunnel Trust provides underground canal tours and a visitor centre. Castle Hill and Zoological gardens is a site of geological and cultural interest. Dudley Castle of motte and bailey construction dates back to the 11th century.\n\nSee also\n UNESCO Global Geoparks\n List of National Geoparks\n Sustainable tourism\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n\n2020 establishments in England\nGeology of England\nGeoparks in England\nGlobal Geoparks Network members\nWest Midlands (county)\nUNESCO"}

{"eng_Latn":"Midland & Scottish Air Ferries was Scotland's first airline, operating from 1933 to 1934. It is particularly noted for pioneering flights to the Inner Hebrides\n\nHistory\n\nFoundation\nJohn Cuthill Sword started Midland Bus Services in Airdrie, to the east of Glasgow in 1924, and it grew into a substantial concern, operating over 500 buses. He was a pioneer of diesel engines for motor transport vehicles. In 1929 Midland Bus Services was merged into Scottish Transport, which in June 1932 was renamed Western SMT, part of the Scottish Motor Traction (SMT) company based in Edinburgh. As a result, Sword was paid around \u00a3290,000 () for his company, became general manager of Western SMT, and was appointed to the SMT board.\n\nSMT,  in which the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) held a stake, had itself been active in aviation; from July to October 1932 it had operated several aircraft which it used for route surveying and pleasure flights. It had also been granted licences to fly between Newcastle and the north of Scotland. Notwithstanding that, on 10 March 1933  Sword, with his wife Christina, founded their own airline, Midland & Scottish Air Ferries (M&SAF), with \u00a320,000 capital. He is reported to have believed that \"so long as the main-line railway routes are avoided there are air-service prospects in this small country of ours\". His plans focused on over-water routes from Glasgow.\n\nJohn Sword had already ordered several aircraft, the first to be delivered to his base at Glasgow's Renfrew Airport being De Havilland Fox Moth G-ACBZ, which arrived on 8 February. Airspeed Ferry G-ACBT came fresh from the manufacturer's factory in York on 12 February. Sword ordered a second Ferry and three more Fox Moths the same month \u2013 his total investment in aircraft costing \u00a312,000.\n\nHe was also assembling his staff. He hired SMT's chief pilot Harold Malet and their chief engineer Sandy Jack. He also hired Johnny Rae (a De Havilland test pilot), Jimmy Orrell (an ex RAF fighter pilot, later to become chief test pilot of Avro), Michael Noel Mavrogordato (ex De Havilland) and Winnie Drinkwater, all qualified engineers and pilots. Drinkwater was an enthusiastic pilot and engineer, newly qualified and only nineteen years of age when Sword took her on, the world's first female commercial pilot. Her elder sister Mary was appointed receptionist and book-keeper, soon to become company secretary.\n\nOperations\n\nSoon after the delivery of his first Airspeed Ferry, Sword put it to work on a temporary service linking Castle Bromwich Aerodrome with Liverpool (Hooton Park) and with London's Heston Airport in connection with the British Industries Fair from 19 February to 2 March 1933, an operation he repeated for the following year's Fair, again with the Ferries.  The 1933 event took place before Sword's airline was formed.\n \nThe airline's first operational flight took place on 18 April 1933. Johnny Rae and Jimmy Orrell flew Dragons G-ACCU and G-ACCT from Renfrew to The Strath, a farmer's field near Campbeltown, later known as Strathfield. They carried company officials, press, a photographer, and newspapers, and were welcomed by a delegation of local dignitaries. This was the start of daily services (except Sundays). On the 20th, a Fox Moth flown by Jimmy Rae went on from Campbeltown to take newspapers to Bowmore on Islay. Winifred Drinkwater flew the route on the 27th in Fox Moth G-ACBZ, the world's first commercial flight piloted by a woman. G-ACBT made the first Airspeed Ferry flight to Campbeltown on 11 May.\n\nSword ordered a new Dragon, G-ACCZ, with adaptations to carry stretchers, and told local hospitals of his plan. The aircraft arrived on 14 May, and the next day the first call came in to take a seriously ill fisherman from Bridgend, Islay, to Glasgow. The patient was accompanied by a Glaswegian nurse who was holidaying on Islay, and the trip was made successfully \u2013 Scotland's first official air ambulance flight.\n\nThe Campbeltown service was officially extended to Bridgend on Islay from 16 May 1933.\n\nOn 18 May a navy vessel, heavy cruiser HMS Frobisher, with a crew of 700 arrived in Campbeltown Loch and ordered bread from a bakery in Glasgow which was delivered by the evening flight \u2013 the airline's first freight operation.\n\nSoon the Campbeltown service was also extended to Rothesay, and, on 31 May, to Belfast Aldergrove Airport, using the newly delivered Avro 618 Ten, G-ACGF, so called because it could carry eight passengers (plus a crew of two). This was Aldergrove's first sustained commercial route. The aircraft was later used on the direct routes from Glasgow to Belfast and to Liverpool. There were now two flights daily on these routes (except Sundays).\n\nOn 14 June 1933 Jimmy Orrell conducted a three-day survey of landing sites throughout the Hebrides in G-ACCZ, making the first landing on the beach at Traigh Mh\u00f2r, Barra, still the site of Barra's airport. However M&SAF never started services to Barra or any other Outer Hebrides islands.\n\nRenfrew Airport was often closed by fog, so the airline used \"The Meadow\" airfield at Monkton, later known as Prestwick Airport, for diversions. When that happened, two Rolls-Royce Twenty cars were available to drive there to collect the passengers. If necessary, a converted REO Speed Wagon caravan could be taken there in which the airline crew or engineers could rest.\n\nWinifred Drinkwater was kept busy, doing scheduled and air ambulance flights and charters, which included a monster-spotting flight over Loch Ness.\n\nSword now turned his attention away from Glasgow and the Inner Hebrides, and started operations from Liverpool, first across the River Mersey at Hooton Park, then at Speke Airport as soon as that opened. His first route from Liverpool was to Dublin, starting on 1 September 1933 using the Avro Ten. Operations also started at Blackpool's Stanley Park Aerodrome, from where he started a route to the Isle of Man, and operated pleasure flights, mainly with the Fox Moths. He also set up an engineering base there.\n\nA popular charter operation operated by the Ferries at Stanley Park was for viewing the night-time Illuminations, with the airport lit by floodlight mounted on a lorry. An unusual episode occurred when a Ferry made a forced landing on the beach at Southport because of failure of an outer engine. Pilot Jimmy Orrell went to fly it back to Renfrew, and found that the ground engineer had removed the offending engine and stowed it in the cabin, to save the drag. Orrell flew the aircraft home in that condition with no problems.\n\nAfter an uneventful winter, Sword was planning for expansion in 1934. On 6 April, he took delivery of a new, unique aeroplane from Avro, the model 642\/2m Eighteen G-ACFV. With a sixteen-passenger capacity, this was a big step for the airline, and Sword had arranged a suitable ceremony to announce it. On that day, he collected his new aircraft from Woodford Aerodrome and flew to Castle Bromwich to pick up some of the launching party en route to Speke. There, the aircraft was named Marchioness of Londonderry by the lady herself, accompanied by her husband, Lord Londonderry who was the Secretary of State for Air. Also attending were Lt-Col Sir Francis Shelmerdine, the Director-General of Civil Aviation, and the Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald. After this prestigious launch, the Prime Minister and others were flown to Heston Aerodrome.\n\nSword was a friend of Ted Hillman, another bus operator who was running an airline, Hillman's Airways, from London's Romford airfield, and they agreed that Sword should start a service from Glasgow to London via Liverpool, and on, with Hillman's, to Paris\u2013Le Bourget Airport. He was apparently abandoning his intention to avoid competition with the railways. The service started on 9 April 1934, twice daily except Sundays, with the Avro 642 serving along with others of Sword's fleet. The Paris service could also be accessed through a service from Belfast via the Isle of Man to Liverpool.\n\nDemise\nAll the airline's activity was going on while Sword was employed as a director with SMT. The other directors of SMT, some of whom were also directors of the newly formed Railway Air Services, with whom he was now blatantly competing, now decided that things had gone too far, and gave Sword an ultimatum that he should give up either his employment with SMT or his airline. He chose the latter. Other factors contributing to this decision may have been that Sword saw little prospect of making a profit from his venture, and the crash in June of the pride of his fleet, the Avro Eighteen, may have disheartened him.\n\nMost of the routes were stopped on 14 July 1934, with no obvious attempt to sell the airline as a going concern, the aircraft being disposed of individually over the following months. On 4 September 1934 Sword joined Eric Gandar Dower, owner of Aberdeen Airways, in a flight in the latter's Short Scion from Renfrew to Campbeltown and Islay. Gandar Dower was possibly evaluating the route with a view to taking it over, but nothing came of it. The only remaining route, to Islay, was shut down on 30 September. Midland & Scottish Air Ferries Ltd went into voluntary liquidation in February 1938.\n\nHowever Sword employed Charles Almond, an instructor with the Scottish Flying Club at Renfrew, to fly Dragon G-ACJS which was retained on stand-by to perform air ambulance flights until other arrangements could be made. The aircraft was sold to Northern & Scottish Airways on 7 January 1935 and they continued the ambulance service.\n\nRoutes\nFrom timetable dated 9 June 1934 (No Sunday services on any route)\n\nGlasgow (Renfrew) \u2014 Liverpool (Speke) \u2014 London (Romford) \u2014 Le Bourget (twice daily)\nBelfast (Aldergrove) \u2014 Isle of Man (Ronaldsway) \u2014 Liverpool \u2014 London \u2014 Le Bourget (twice daily)\nBlackpool (Stanley Park) \u2014 Liverpool (twice daily)\nGlasgow \u2014 Campbeltown (Strath Aerodrome) \u2014 Belfast (twice daily)\nGlasgow \u2014 Campbeltown \u2014 Islay (Duich Aerodrome) (daily)\nConnections\nAt London (Romford) with Hillman's Airways for Paris\nAt Liverpool with K.L.M. to Hull, Rotterdam, Hanover and Berlin\n\nFleet \n\nLivery consisted of white overall with red markings, struts, and wheel spats.

{"eng_Latn":"Aryaman Tea Estate is a tea garden, located in the Madarihat-Birpara CD block in the Alipurduar subdivision of the Alipurduar district in the Indian state of West Bengal.\n\nEtymology\nIt is named after the great grandson of the eminent businessman, B.K.Birla.\n\nGeography\n\nLocation \nAryaman Tea Estate is located in the Jaldapara National Park and Leopard Rehabilitation Centre, Kherbari. The nearest railway station is at Madarihat. Bagdogra Airport is 155 km away.\n\nArea overview\nAlipurduar district is covered by two maps. It is an extensive area in the eastern end of the Dooars in West Bengal. It is undulating country, largely forested, with numerous rivers flowing down from the outer ranges of the Himalayas in Bhutan. It is a predominantly rural area with 79.38% of the population living in the rural areas. The district has 1 municipal town and 20 census towns and that means that 20.62% of the population lives in the urban areas. The scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, taken together, form more than half the population in all the six community development blocks in the district. There is a high concentration of tribal people (scheduled tribes) in the three northern blocks of the district.\n\nNote: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivision. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map.\n\nDooars-Terai tea\nTea gardens in the Dooars and Terai regions produce 226 million kg or over a quarter of India's total tea crop. The Dooars region contains wild-life rich tropical forests, undulating plains and low hills. Innumerable streams and rivers descend from the mountains of Bhutan and flow through the fertile plains in the Dooars region. The elevation of the Dooars area ranges from 90 m to 1750 m and it receives around 350\u00a0cm of rain. The Dooars-Terai tea is characterized by a bright, smooth and full-bodied liquor that's a wee bit lighter than Assam tea. Cultivation of tea in the Dooars was primarily pioneered and promoted by the British but there was significant contribution of Indian entrepreneurs.\n\nThe garden\nAryaman Tea Estate was acquired by Jayshree Tea and Industries in 1994. It made huge investments in creating a tea plantation on a land laid waste by wild animals. A factory to produce quality CTC tea was set up in 1999. The estate has received a Certificate for Excellence from M\/s J. Thomas & Company Private Limited for the highest CTC tea sold in Siliguri auction for a number of years. Tea cultivation area is 222 hectares, all of which is irrigated.\n\nJay Shree Tea\nThe other tea gardens of the Jay Shree Tea & Industries Ltd., owned by the B.K.Birla group, in the Dooars-Terai region are: Kumarika, Marionbarie and Jayantika.\n\nReferences\n\nTea estates in West Bengal\nAlipurduar district\nTourist attractions in Alipurduar district"}

The name implies that the author is paving a new way to study a legend. The name also hints at the name of the author (Ayah evokes HaRaAYaH, the acronym for the rabbi's Hebrew name) and the name of Ein Ya'akov.\n\nIn his introduction, \"Rav Kook\" writes that he came to write it because of the paucity (in quality and quantity) of \"easy to read\" Jewish books in his time. The commentary is presented in numbered paragraphs corresponding to the Talmudic text, and it expands upon many diverse subjects in an allegorical style.\nThe book's introduction is considered significant in its own right. Among other things, Rav Kook presents a historical and philosophical view of the Second Temple period, during which rabbis and Talmudic scholars faced significant persecution from Roman authorities.\n\nRav Kook began writing the book at the age of 18. It appears that his original intention was to write a comprehensive commentary on all the legends of the Talmud. Completion of the book was delayed for many reasons over the years, however, and as a result, there are significant differences in the style and character of writing throughout it. Much of the book was written during Rav Kook's rabbinical period in Latvia, and the minority after his immigration to the Land of Israel. \nThe print edition of the book comprises four volumes, which speaks to the large amount of content in Ein Yaakov. The manuscript of the book was edited multiple times for publication: once in Eastern Europe and the other in Jaffa (the Jaffa edition was published in full by the Hartzia Institute). At the end of his life, Rav Kook began to write another edition of the book, which included an interpretation of three pages of the Gemara. This last addition is presented in the new prints at the end of the first and fourth volumes.\n\nRav Kook's writings are extensive, and he is considered one of the most celebrated and influential rabbis of the 20th century.

{"eng_Latn":"Holy Name of Jesus Parish is a Roman Catholic church in Redlands, California, United States, founded on July 1, 2006. It is part of the Diocese of San Bernardino. The Church is located on two sites, on the north side of town is the Columbia Street location formerly Saint Mary's Catholic Church. And the south side of Redlands, at the Olive Avenue location is the former Sacred Heart Catholic Church.\n\nHistory \nThe first known Christian settlement in Redlands, CA. was the catholic San Bernardino de Sena Estancia by Francisco Dumetz. Established in 1819 on the feast day of Saint Bernardine. Part of an outpost of the Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel located 56 miles away near Los Angeles, CA. A days trip walking. No large populations existed. Used to convert local native Tongva, Serrano, and Cahuilla Native Americans. With Spanish colonization and the subsequent Mexican era the area was sparsely populated at the land grant Ranchos, considering it unsuitable for an actual mission. The estancia was sold to Jos\u00e9 del Carmen Lugo who made it his home. \n\nThe Discalced Carmelite Friars of the California-Arizona Province established in 1952 a retreat campus. The Carmelo Retreat House. Located adjacent to Ford Street Park.\n\nSacred Heart\n\nAfter American annexation in 1848, large amounts of European-Americans arrived, Redlands was officially founded in 1881 and many European, Californios and Mexican Catholics moved into the area there after. Before any specific place of worship was constructed, community members worshiped in a local community center and local rented store fronts for $10 a month. The first building constructed was the Sacred Heart Academy with a small parish. The chapel opened in 1896 as Sacred Heart Catholic Parish and the academy opened previously in 1887. This is what is now known as the Olive Avenue location site. Both located at the current Olive Avenue address. The current church was re-constructed in 1963 in Postmodern architecture.\n\nSaint Mary's\n\nThe north Redlands Parish location was founded by the Mexican-American community. Mostly by not feeling welcomed at Sacred Heart. They built their own chapel called Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Parish in the orange groves of north Redlands in January 1938. A mostly Hispanic neighborhood. The church female \"Do\u00f1as\"  raised funds to construct a larger church. Selling \"conchas and tamales\" to raise funds. The current church was built and renamed St. Mary's in 1941, then physically moved to its current location on Columbia Street in 1986. Built in Mission Revival architecture.\n\nMerger\nThe diocese of San Bernardino was concerned with the concept of one community with two separated churches. Historically, each location self segregated in the 1930s. Mostly to accommodate Anglo parishioners, who dissuaded Hispanics from attending Sacred Heart Church already established. To amend this, the diocese decided to create one sole church in the City of Redlands to create unity, simplicity for worshipers and the church. They established the Holy Name of Jesus Catholic Church in 2006. Named \u2018\u2019Iglesia Catolica Santo Nombre de Jesus\u2019\u2019 in Spanish.\nAmong the highlights of the merger, the parishioners hold a yearly traditional Marian procession from Columbia St. to mass at the Olive Ave. location on Our Lady of Guadalupe feast day, December 12. The 1.5 mile procession thru downtown Redlands with help from local authorities. Mostly traffic control.\n\nRelocation\nAnnounced in 2015, the church purchased a lot and is currently raising funds to relocate to a new location at the northeast side of town. A vacant lot on the northwest corner of Lugonia Avenue and Dearborn Street. The plans include a 35,000 square ft campus, a 1,500 person capacity church to service over 3,000 families and a new Sacred Heart campus to service over 600 students of the Academy.

This means for any real numbers  we have\n.\nBut, there are algebras  which are not necessarily associative, meaning if  then\n\nin general. There is a notion of algebras, called -algebras, which still have a property on the multiplication which still acts like the first relation, meaning associativity holds, but only holds up to a homotopy, which is a way to say after an operation \"compressing\" the information in the algebra, the multiplication is associative. This means although we get something which looks like the second equation, the one of inequality, we actually get equality after \"compressing\" the information in the algebra.\n\nThe study of -algebras is a subset of homotopical algebra, where there is a homotopical notion of associative algebras through a differential graded algebra with a multiplication operation and a series of higher homotopies giving the failure for the multiplication to be associative. Loosely, an -algebra  is a -graded vector space over a field  with a series of operations  on the -th tensor powers of . The  corresponds to a chain complex differential,  is the multiplication map, and the higher  are a measure of the failure of associativity of the . When looking at the underlying cohomology algebra , the map  should be an associative map. Then, these higher maps  should be interpreted as higher homotopies, where  is the failure of  to be associative,  is the failure for  to be higher associative, and so forth. Their structure was originally discovered by Jim Stasheff while studying A\u221e-spaces, but this was interpreted as a purely algebraic structure later on. These are spaces equipped with maps that are associative only up to homotopy, and the A\u221e structure keeps track of these homotopies, homotopies of homotopies, and so forth.\n\nThey are ubiquitous in homological mirror symmetry because of their necessity in defining the structure of the Fukaya category of D-branes on a Calabi\u2013Yau manifold who have only a homotopy associative structure.\n\nDefinition\n\nDefinition \nFor a fixed field  an -algebra is a -graded vector space\n\nsuch that for  there exist degree , -linear maps\n\nwhich satisfy a coherence condition:\n,\nwhere .\n\nUnderstanding the coherence conditions \nThe coherence conditions are easy to write down for low degreespgs 583\u2013584.\n\nd=1 \nFor  this is the condition that\n,\nsince  giving  and . These two inequalities force  in the coherence condition, hence the only input of it is from . Therefore  represents a differential.\n\nd=2 \nUnpacking the coherence condition for  gives the degree  map . In the sum there are the inequalities\n\nof indices giving  equal to . Unpacking the coherence sum gives the relation\n,\nwhich when rewritten with\n and \nas the differential and multiplication, it is\n,\nwhich is the Leibniz rule for differential graded algebras.\n\nd=3 \nIn this degree the associativity structure comes to light. Note if  then there is a differential graded algebra structure, which becomes transparent after expanding out the coherence condition and multiplying by an appropriate factor of , the coherence condition reads something like\n\nNotice that the left hand side of the equation is the failure for  to be an associative algebra on the nose. One of the inputs for the first three  maps are coboundaries since  is the differential, so on the cohomology algebra  these elements would all vanish since . This includes the final term  since it is also a coboundary, giving a zero element in the cohomology algebra. From these relations we can interpret the  map as a failure for the associativity of , meaning it is associative only up to homotopy.\n\nd=4 and higher order terms \nMoreover, the higher order terms, for , the coherent conditions give many different terms combining a string of consecutive  into some  and inserting that term into an  along with the rest of the 's in the elements . When combining the  terms, there is a part of the coherence condition which reads similarly to the right hand side of , namely, there are terms\n\nIn degree  the other terms can be written out as\n\nshowing how elements in the image of  and  interact. This means the homotopy of elements, including one that's in the image of  minus the multiplication of elements where one is a homotopy input, differ by a boundary. For higher order , these middle terms can be seen how the middle maps  behave with respect to terms coming from the image of another higher homotopy map.\n\nDiagrammatic interpretation of axioms \nThere is a nice diagrammatic formalism of algebras which is described in Algebra+Homotopy=Operad explaining how to visually think about this higher homotopies. This intuition is encapsulated with the discussion above algebraically, but it is useful to visualize it as well.\n\nExamples\n\nAssociative algebras \nEvery associative algebra  has an -infinity structure by defining  and  for . Hence -algebras generalize associative algebras.\n\nDifferential graded algebras \nEvery differential graded algebra  has a canonical structure as an -algebra where  and  is the multiplication map. All other higher maps  are equal to . Using the structure theorem for minimal models, there is a canonical -structure on the graded cohomology algebra  which preserves the quasi-isomorphism structure of the original differential graded algebra. One common example of such dga's comes from the Koszul algebra arising from a regular sequence. This is an important result because it helps pave the way for the equivalence of homotopy categoriesof differential graded algebras and -algebras.\n\nCochain algebras of H-spaces \nOne of the motivating examples of -algebras comes from the study of H-spaces. Whenever a topological space  is an H-space, its associated singular chain complex  has a canonical -algebra structure from its structure as an H-space.\n\nExample with infinitely many non-trivial mi \nConsider the graded algebra  over a field  of characteristic  where  is spanned by the degree  vectors  and  is spanned by the degree  vector . Even in this simple example there is a non-trivial -structure which gives differentials in all possible degrees. This is partially due to the fact there is a degree  vector, giving a degree  vector space of rank  in . Define the differential  by\n\nand for \n\nwhere  on any map not listed above and . In degree , so for the multiplication map, we have\n\nAnd in  the above relations give\n\nWhen relating these equations to the failure for associativity, there exist non-zero terms. For example, the coherence conditions for  will give a non-trivial example where associativity doesn't hold on the nose. Note that in the cohomology algebra  we have only the degree  terms  since  is killed by the differential .\n\nProperties\n\nTransfer of A\u221e structure \nOne of the key properties of -algebras is their structure can be transferred to other algebraic objects given the correct hypotheses. An early rendition of this property was the following: Given an -algebra  and a homotopy equivalence of complexes\n,\nthen there is an -algebra structure on  inherited from  and  can be extended to a morphism of -algebras. There are multiple theorems of this flavor with different hypotheses on  and , some of which have stronger results, such as uniqueness up to homotopy for the structure on  and strictness on the map .\n\nStructure\n\nMinimal models and Kadeishvili's theorem \n\nOne of the important structure theorems for -algebras is the existence and uniqueness of minimal models \u2013 which are defined as -algebras where the differential map  is zero. Taking the cohomology algebra  of an -algebra  from the differential , so as a graded algebra,\n,\nwith multiplication map . It turns out this graded algebra can then canonically be equipped with an -structure,\n,\nwhich is unique up-to quasi-isomorphisms of -algebras. In fact, the statement is even stronger: there is a canonical -morphism\n,\nwhich lifts the identity map of . Note these higher products are given by the Massey product.\n\nMotivation \nThis theorem is very important for the study of differential graded algebras because they were originally introduced to study the homotopy theory of rings. Since the cohomology operation kills the homotopy information, and not every differential graded algebra is quasi-isomorphic to its cohomology algebra, information is lost by taking this operation. But, the minimal models let you recover the quasi-isomorphism class while still forgetting the differential. There is an analogous result for A\u221e-categories by Maxim Kontsevich and Yan Soibelman, giving an A\u221e-category structure on the cohomology category  of the dg-category consisting of cochain complexes of coherent sheaves on a non-singular variety  over a field  of characteristic  and morphisms given by the total complex of the Cech bi-complex of the differential graded sheaf pg 586-593. In this was, the degree  morphisms in the category  are given by .\n\nApplications \nThere are several applications of this theorem. In particular, given a dg-algebra, such as the de Rham algebra , or the Hochschild cohomology algebra, they can be equipped with an -structure.\n\nMassey structure from DGA's \nGiven a differential graded algebra  its minimal model as an -algebra  is constructed using the Massey products. That is,\n\nIt turns out that any -algebra structure on  is closely related to this construction. Given another -structure on  with maps , there is the relation\n,\nwhere\n.\nHence all such -enrichments on the cohomology algebra are related to one another.\n\nGraded algebras from its ext algebra \nAnother structure theorem is the reconstruction of an algebra from its ext algebra. Given a connected graded algebra\n,\nit is canonically an associative algebra. There is an associated algebra, called its Ext algebra, defined as\n,\nwhere multiplication is given by the Yoneda product. Then, there is an -quasi-isomorphism between  and . This identification is important because it gives a way to show that all derived categories are derived affine, meaning they are isomorphic the derived category of some algebra.\n\nSee also \n A\u221e-category\n Associahedron\n Mirror symmetry conjecture\nHomological mirror symmetry\nHomotopy Lie algebra\nDerived algebraic geometry\n\nReferences \n\n \u2014 Original paper linking  structures to Mirror symmetry\n\nAlgebra\nHomotopical algebra\nHomological algebra\nAlgebraic geometry\nHomotopy theory"}

As described by Pedro de Madrazo, the sculptural group comprised three statues: an equestrian statue representing Isabella, who appears dressed in armour and with a royal crown and mantle, carrying the sceptre in one hand and the bridles of the horse in the other; the statue of the Cardinal of Spain Pedro Gonz\u00e1lez de Mendoza, dressed in a cassock with the book of the Gospels in his right hand and leaning the other on one of the bridles of the Queen's horse; and the statue of the great captain Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, armed from the tip of his head, with his naked sword in his left hand, and holding the other bridle of the horse with his right hand; all three statues are supported by a bronze basement.\n\nThe monument was moved from its original location to a location near the Paseo de la Castellana, in the gardens placed at the feet of the National Museum of Natural Sciences.\n\nThe pedestal features the coat of arms of Madrid and those of the Catholic Monarchs, and an engraved inscription reads: \"To Isabella the Catholic, under whose glorious reign national unity and the discovery of the Americas took place. The People of Madrid. 1883.\" This text was criticised by Pedro de Madrazo in 1883 as lacking in historical rigour, based on issues such as certain events fulfilling the aforementioned \"national unity\" happening after the death of Isabella in 1504 (the formal independence of Aragon did not come to an end until the death of Ferdinand of Aragon in 1516 or the annexation of Navarre to Castile in 1515).\n\nIt has been highlighted as a notable example of the exaltation of Spanish nationalism during the Restoration in the Spanish capital's public art.

Her first submission was a vase of flowers, copied from one of Camradt's works. It was in gouache, a technique used by the older flower painters at the time. She subsequently worked with oils, depicting flowers in vases, bowls or baskets. In later life, she included wild flowers and outdoor plants. Inspired by Bertel Thorvaldsen, in 1831 she began to paint flowers in Etruscan vases.

{"eng_Latn":"USS Havre (PCE(C)-877) was a United States Navy  escort in commission from 14 February 1944 to 1 July 1970. She served in the Central Pacific during World War II, supporting invasions of Battle of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa, and was present in Tokyo Bay for the formal Surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945. Unlike other ships from this class, which were scrapped or sold to other nations, the vessel stayed the property of the United States Navy, which transferred ownership to the United States Navy Reserve as Naval Reserve Training Ship for 9th Naval District (Chicago) in April 1954. She was renamed USS Havre (PCE-877) on 15 February 1956 as part of a Navy-wide initiative to provide names to all numbered ships.  Havre served on the Great Lakes until struck from Navy List on 1 July 1970.\n\nConstruction and commissioning\n\nThe USS Havre was laid down on 6 May 1943 at Albina Engine & Machine Works, Portland, Oregon, as Patrol Craft Escort, PCE-877. The PCEs were designed for general escort work and provided a cheaper and quicker alternative to the larger destroyers, while maintaining a substantial amount of detection and ranging gear used for locating submarines. The ship was launched 11 August 1943. The launching of the PCE 877 was a celebrated occasion that was noted in the 10 August 1943 edition of the Corvallis Gazette-Times of Corvallis, Oregon. On 11 August 1943, Marjorie L. Wooton, daughter of local Colonel Elmer V. Wooton, recent recipient of the Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army), christened the PCE 877 in the presence of a crowd that included Oregon governor Earl Snell.\n\nThe PCE-877 was commissioned on 14 February 1944 at the Albina Engine & Machine Works shipyard, Portland, Oregon. According to the U.S. Navy Muster Rolls, the PCE-877 set out with Commanding Officer Coleman H. Smith, Lieutenant, USNR, Executive Officer John R. Shea, Jr., Lieutenant, USNR, several additional officers and an initial crew of 87. The vessel received its fitting out and shakedown over the next six weeks, departing Portland, Oregon on 25 February 1944, docking in Astoria, Oregon on 26 February 1944, arriving in San Pedro, California (SCTC Terminal Island) on 6 March 1944, before finally arriving at Naval Base San Diego, California on 21 March 1944.\n\nService history\n\nWorld War II Pacific Theatre operations\n\nInitial Deployment, Conversion to Control Vessel\n\nStarting 1 April 1944, the PCE-877 began its escort duties as Patrol and Escort, Central Pacific region, while still based at Naval Base San Diego. At 1200 hours on 11 September 1944, the PCE-877 officially was underway to Naval Station Pearl Harbor as part of Task Unit 116.1.2.  The ship proceeded to the northern part of San Clemente Island, California where the crew \"ran a measured mile to check the accuracy and adjust our newly installed DRT (Dead Reckoning Tracer).\"\n\nAt 1030 hours 19 September 1944, the PCE-877 arrived at Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii for conversion to a Central Control Vessel for Amphibious Force. The Navy control groups were responsible for the control of the assault waves of landing ships, landing craft, and amphibious vehicles from the transport and landing ship areas to the landing beaches. From 20 September 1944 to 3 November 1944 the ship was docked at D.E. Dock #1 Pearl Harbor for the installation of radio and communications equipment. During this period, the crew \"conducted various exercises and tests throughout month. All gun crews attended AA schools. Damage Control parties attended fire fighting school. AS\/W attack team spent one day operating with tame submerging and attended attack teacher a total of 8 hours.\"\n\nRefitting was completed on 2 December 1944, and for six days the PCE-877 acted as Officer in tactical command (OTC) for a training group of control vessels between Pearl Harbor and Waianae, Hawaii. A second series of drills and exercises starting 18 December 1944 running nine days saw the PCE-877 acting as an Escort Commander for screening and as a Line of Departure Control Vessel in simulated landing operations.\n\nOn 14 December 1944, Lieutenant Coleman H. Smith, USNR, was relieved as Commanding Officer of the PCE-877 by Lieutenant John R. Shea, Jr., USNR.  Lieutenant James B. Brady, USNR was promoted to Executive Officer. (Lt. Smith would advance to the rank of Commander, and after the war was a long-serving director of the War Gaming Department at the US Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island.)\n\nThe PCE-877 participated in several additional exercises on 3 January 1945 (three days) and 11 January 1945 (eight days) as part of Administrative Command Amphibious Forces, US Pacific Fleet. The ship was ordered to move to mooring Easy 7 at Pearl Harbor for logistics and supply.\n\nBattle of Iwo Jima\n\nOn 22 January 1945, the PCE-877 departed Pearl Harbor as part of Task Force 51, Joint Expeditionary Force, Commander Amphibious Forces Pacific 53.3, conducting screening operations for Tractor Group BAKER en-route to Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands, arriving 3 February 1945. After two days of logistics and resupply, Tractor Group BAKER continued on to Saipan, the largest island of the Northern Mariana Islands, with PCE-877 continuing patrol and screening operations. The group arrived in Saipan Harbor the morning of 10 February 1945.\n\nStarting 12 February 1945, the PCE 877 continued as Central Control Vessel as part of nighttime landing exercises. There was difficulty in re-embarking the LVTs (Landing Vehicle Tracked), as their parent LST (Landing Ship Tank) had moved to a sheltered position, and the PCE-877 \"acted as a guide to round up stray LVTs and help them to their mother ship.\"\n\nAfter completing logistical operations in Saipan Harbor, the PCE-877 shipped out at 1350 hours on 15 February 1945, proceeding as part of TU 51.13.6, performing screening operations for Tractor Group BAKER, en-route to Iwo Jima, Volcano Islands, to join the invasion force.  On 18 February 1945, the PCE-877 encountered a radar contact at 2,000 yards, readied for a depth charge attack, but \"at 300 yards it became apparent that our contact was [a school of] large fish.\"\n\nAt 0540 of 19 February 1945, the PCE-877 secured from screening operations and proceeded independently to assume duties as Central Control Vessel. Once at the transport area, the ship began dispatching waves of landing craft on schedule. All assault waves were dispatched on schedule, and the ship maintained station for the entire day, except when on standby as rescue vessel for the U.S.S. LSM 211 (Landing Ship Medium) -  (see List of United States Navy Landing Ship Medium (LSMs)), which had been damaged by mortar fire. The PCE-877 was under fire several times, but received no hits.  The PCE-877 stayed on station until 21 February 1945, then left station and conducted rescue and salvage operations, aiding stray and sinking LVTs and LCVP (United States). Rough seas caused several craft to drift seaward. \"One LVT was stripped of salvageable items and sunk by gunfire from this vessel.\" This LVT eventually collided with the PCE-877's starboard propeller while tied alongside, causing slight damage.\n\nOn 22 February 1945, the ship conducted patrols in the area, and two days later joined TU 51.2 for screening duties as the convoy left the operations area en-route to Leyte, Philippines by way of Saipan. On 2 March 1945, the PCE-877 anchored in the outer harbor of Saipan and proceeded with logistics, but was not able to complete refueling in the short time allowed for the group, and continued underway on 3 March 1945. At 1630 on 9 March 1945 the PCE-877 anchored off Dulag, Leyte. Starting 10 March 1945, the ship took aboard stores and provisions and made repairs on sound gear (due to a transformer failure) and on the starboard screw. The damage to the propeller caused \"excessive vibrations which had been present at speeds between 11 and 14 knots.\"  Starting 15 March 1945, the PCE-877 acted as the central control vessel directing practice landings on Leyte, while completing the sonar and propeller repairs over ten days.\n\nBattle of Okinawa\nOn 24 March 1945 the PCE-877 departed Leyte Bay with ComLST Flotilla 21 en-route for Okinawa. The fleet encountered six days of increasing high seas (categorized as \"high\" with up to 30 foot waves on the Douglas sea scale and winds topping 55 knots). The storm ended on 31 March 1945, and the fleet arrived on 1 April 1945 to waters off Okinawa Island.\n\nThe PCE-877 was detached from screening duties and proceeded to attack station, which was assumed on schedule. \"Enemy aircraft caused interference for a short period of time during approach to station, but the principal cause of concern was the closeness of our own ship's anti-aircraft fire.\". The ship went on night retirement with units of Tractor Group \"Dog\", and was able to refuel on 2 April 1945. Working again at night that evening with Tractor Group \"Dog\", an \"error in navigation led the group into dangerous water on the west side of Mae Shima [sic - Maejima] and this ship left screening station to keep clear of the reefs.\". Later that morning at 0118 3 April 1945 a mine-like object was sighted and sunk by small arms fire from the PCE-877. The ship continued on night work for several days, and managed to avoid \"suicide planes\" that attacked ships in the transport area. \"Friendly ships fired and shot down three FMs Mitsubishi F1M over land in the vicinity of the airstrip east of Purple Beach.\"\n\nOn 8 April 1945, the PCE-877 proceeded from an anchorage off the western beaches of Okinawa to anchor in Karame Retto  harbor (Kerama Islands), and the next day rendezvoused with the flotilla and proceeded to Guam. Along the way on 10 April 1945 the ship made an urgent attack with a shallow pattern of depth charges on what turned out to be a whale. On 13 April 1945, the crew received of the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and a five-minute silence and prayer in his memory was observed on 14 April 1945. On 16 April orders came in that the group was to be diverted to Ulithi Atoll in the Caroline Islands for a 21-day availability, arriving 17 April 1945. Over these three weeks, the main engine was overhauled, further repairs to the starboard propeller we attempted and continued vibration issues reported to Service Squadron Ten.\n\nOn 13 May 1945, the PCE-877 reported ready for sea, and was assigned as an escort vessel for Task Unit 94.18.10 heading back to Okinawa, departing 15 May 1945. The ship arrived at Okinawa 21 May 1945 and was ordered to continue screening and patrolling off the western beaches of Okinawa. At 2140 on 24 May 1945, \"an enemy Betty (Mitsubishi G4M bomber) flying at 2000 ft. was taken under fire. 3 rounds of 3\"\/50; 119 rounds of 40MM and 97 rounds of 20MM ammunition were expended.\" Numerous enemy raids were reported over the next several days, but the PCE-877.\n\nAt 0012 on 28 May 1945, an enemy plane passed directly overhead, causing radar-controlled anti-aircraft fire for several minutes, with hundreds of rounds bursting close aboard. No serious casualties were reported, with two men slightly wounded. Twelve minutes later (0024) an enemy suicide plane crashed into the USS LCS 119 (Landing Craft Support) just to the south of the PCE-877's position. The PCE-877 was the closest ship and proceeded to the LCS 119's aid. \"The ship had been hit just aft of amidships on the starboard side and was burning badly. She had no pressure on her fire main and her magazines amidships were exploding. We were forced to back clear of her after coming alongside as an enemy plane was sighted several miles distance and approaching. We fired on this plane expending 1 round of 3\"\/50 and 24 rounds of 40mm ammunition. After firing, a small fire was observed in this plane. The plane was then fired on by another vessel after having passed over us. It turned in a slow circle and again approached this vessel but burned and crashed out of control 2,000 yards to our starboard beam. We then lowered our motor whale boat and proceeded alongside the U.S.S. LCS 119 to pick up survivors. 61 survivors from a crew of 75 were rescued, given first aid treatment and later turned over to the USS PCE(R)-855 [(later named USS Rexburg - an Experimental Patrol Craft Escort (Rescue)]. Ten of the survivors were seriously wounded stretcher cases and a majority of the survivors were burned to varying degrees. At 0412 the port main engine failed due to a break in a lube oil line which in turn stripped a series of bearings on the crankshaft.\" At 1640 the PCE-877 was ordered to Kerama Retto for repairs, where the ship was anchored from 29 May 1945 to 8 June 1945.\n\nOn 9 June 1945 the PCE-877 relieved the PCS-1460 (Patrol Craft Sweeper) as patrol near Chimu Wan \/ Kin Bay area, and that evening encountered a native canoe at 0020. \"Four men were in this canoe. The canoe was illuminated and two occupants took to the water about one mile from land. We fired upon the canoe when it became apparent that the canoe would be able to beach before we could get underway and the last two occupants took to the water. We destroyed the canoe and established a patrol in search for the swimmers but were unable to locate them. Numerous large snakes and other marine life were seen in the water which was not an inviting place to swim.\" The PCE-877 was then ordered to proceed to Hagushi on western Okinawa to prepare to join a convoy as an escort.\n\nThe PCE-877 sailed with TU 31.29.3 to Ulithi from 11 June to 17 June 1945, and then joined TU 11.11.4 bound for Leyte Island, Philippines as an escort from 18\u201321 June 1945. For nine days through 30 June 1945, the ship underwent repairs and logistics, including replacing the problematic starboard propeller. While at Leyte Island, the ship participated in amphibious training practice with Army troops at Hinunangan Bay from 1 July to 8 July, and then was sent to U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay for an engine overhaul and eight days availability.\n\nFor the remainder of July 1945 through 24 August 1945, the ship was stationed in Subic Bay and Lingayen Bay participating in further training exercises in amphibious landings conducted with Army troops, as well as patrol and escort duties. On 31 July 1945, the ship was designated as a senior escort vessel and commander of the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) screen in the transport anchorage area.\n\nJapan Surrender\n\nThe crew of the PCE-877 was participating in amphibious training practice with Army troops in and around Luzon and Subic Bay when the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki took place on 6 August and 9 August 1945. Japan then surrendered to the Allies on 15 August 1945. It is uncertain when news of the surrender and the end of hostilities reached the PCE-877 crew (Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz sent out a telegram to the entire Pacific Fleet on 15 August 1945. The ship continued to patrol and provide escort in the Philippines following completion of the amphibious training on 17 August 1945.\n\nAdministratively, the PCE-877 was formally reclassified PCE(C)-877 on 20 August 1945 (even though the conversion to Escort-Control took place 10 months prior at Pearl Harbor). And in late August 1945, Commanding Officer Lieutenant John R. Shea, Jr., USNR, was relieved by Lieutenant Christian G. (\"Dutch\") Schmidt, USNR. Lieutenant Wirt P. Hoxie, USNR, replaced Lt. James B. Brady as Executive Officer. Lt. Shea would later be promoted to Lieutenant Commander and receive the Bronze Star for the Iwo Jima engagements.\n\nOn 25 August 1945 the PCE-877 received orders to escort Transport Group Able en-route to Tokyo Area. The ship had to return to Subic Bay due to weather conditions that day, but then set out at 1738 on 27 August 1945 for Tokyo. The group arrived in the afternoon of 1 September 1945, and the surrender was recorded as 0904 local time 2 September 1945 on the USS Missouri (BB-63) in Tokyo Bay.  The PCE(C)-877 is listed as one of five allied Submarine Chasers present for the formal surrender.\n\nOf the 77 listed crew members in September 1945, 56 had served on the PCE-877 since commission on 14 February 1944 (72%). After the surrender, the ship was stationed in Yokohama Bay off of Tokyo Bay through early October 1945. The ship had a large amounts of \"Speed Letters\" indicating discharges and a imminent return stateside in late September and early October 1945.\n\nPost-War Atlantic operations\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the PCE(C)-877 returned to the United States by way of Pearl Harbor (December 1945-January 1946), where Commanding Officer Lieutenant Christian G. (\"Dutch\") Schmidt, USNR was relieved by Lieutenant Junior Grade John P. Johnson, USNR, with Lt. (jg) Clifford I.D. Beck appointed as Executive Officer.\n\nAfter leaving Pearl Harbor, the PCE(C)-877 shipped to San Diego (February 1946), Balboa, Panama Canal Zone (March 1946), finally arriving in Charleston, South Carolina, in late March 1946. Lt. (jg) Lawrence E. Stream, USNR was appointed Executive Officer on 11 March 1946 after Lt.(jg) Beck was discharged.  On 20 April 1946, Commanding Officer Lieutenant (jg) John P. Johnson, USNR was discharged, and XO Lt. (jg) Lawrence E. Stream was discharged on 1 May 1946. In fact, while the PCE(C)-877 had a post-war operating allowance of 67 crew members, records show on 1 April 1946 that only 44 crew remained on board, and by 1 July 1946, only 26 crew members were aboard. On 20 April 1946, Lieutenant William George (W.G.) Mann, Jr., USNR assumed command of the PCE(C)-877.\n\nFrom 1946 to April 1954 the ship was attached to Amphibious Control Squadron 2, exercising control and coordinating amphibious forces in the assaults from the sea and supporting embarked Marine forces once they are established ashore. During this assignment, the PCE(C)-877 engaged in exercises in the North Atlantic, Chesapeake Bay, and the Caribbean Sea.\n\nNaval Reserve Training Ship - Great Lakes\n\nIn April 1954, the PCE(C)-877 was transitioned from active duty and reassigned as a Naval Reserve Training Ship for 9th Naval District. The ship proceeded from the Gulf of Mexico, via the Mississippi River and Illinois River to Chicago and reported to Naval Station Great Lakes. This coincided with the creation of the new Gunnery School at the Naval Station, which was dedicated in March 1954. On 27 October 1955, the ship was reclassified to PCE-877, its original classification, as it was no longer coordinating amphibious assaults and landings. Just four months later, on 15 February 1956, the ship was renamed the USS Havre (PCE-877) as part of a Navy-wide initiative to provide names to all remaining numbered ships. During its operation, the USS Havre (PCE-877) operated throughout the Great Lakes, engaging in 2-week cruises which provided valuable training for Naval Reservists, including anti-submarine warfare and gunnery exercises.\n\nDecommissioning\n\nThe PCE-877's final voyage was sailing with the Ninth Naval District Reserve Destroyer Division fleet. The USS Havre (PCE-877) had spent sixteen years primarily moored at USNTC Pier Great Lakes Illinois. At 0603 on Monday 27 April 1970, the ship slipped its lines for the final time in Illinois and made voyage for Philadelphia. At 1925 the ship moored port side to the USCG Pier in Manistee, Michigan, meeting up with the USS Portage (PCE-902) and USS Ely (PCE-880). The USS Havre (PCE-877) and USS Ely (PCE-880) steamed out of Manistee together on 28 April 1970, crossed under the Mackinac Bridge at 20:31 and put into port at St. Ignace Municipal Pier at 22:05. On 30 April 1970 the two ships arrived and docked at Port Huron Seaway Terminal Pier in Port Huron, Michigan at 1609.\n\nBoth the 877 and 880 stayed in Port Huron until joined by the USS Portage (PCE-902) on 2 May 1970, where the three ships continued through Lake St. Clair and the Detroit River, entering Lake Erie at 1420. The three ships entered the Maumee River and moored at the Toledo Marine Terminal Pier at 1908. On 4 May 1970 the ships departed Toledo Harbor and steamed for Cleveland, and then Erie, Pennsylvania on 5 May 1970, Buffalo Harbor on 6 May 1970. On 9 May 1970, the ships moved west to an anchorage near Port Colborne, Ontario, Canada and then entered the Welland Canal the next day, entering Lake Ontario at 1812 in a column formation and on 11 May 1945 embarked various Seaway Pilots for transiting segments of the St. Lawrence Seaway, and mooring on 12 May 1945 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Joining the trio in Montreal were the USS Whitehall (PCE-856) and the USS Hollidaysburg (PCS-1385). The next day (13 May), the PCE-877 arrived in Quebec City, along with new member of the group USS Parle (DE 708). On 14 May 1970, the six ships (now called Task Unit 132.9.1) departed in a column formation, steaming for Halifax, Nova Scotia, arriving the morning of 17 May 1970, and departing again the next morning for Naval Weapons Station Earle Pier Complex, Sandy Hook Bay, New Jersey, arriving the morning of 20 May 1970. At 1200 the crew commenced offloading all remaining ammunition. The task unit then steamed around Cape May, New Jersey, entering the Delaware River Channel, and moored at 1240 on 21 May 1970 at Pier #1 Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.  This would be the last time the USS Harve (PCE-877) would move under her own power.\n\nDecommissioning activities commenced in Philadelphia. On 2 June 1970, all main engines, generators and associated equipment placed out of commission. On 5 June 1970, all hazardous material offloaded, and all fuel and lube oil was offloaded on 11 June 1970. The PCE-877 passed both the preliminary inspection conducted by the INACTSHIPMAINTFAC personnel on 18 June 1970, and the final inspection on 24 June 1970.\n\nFrom the Final Deck Logs - Remarks Sheets - Commanding Officer R.C. White, Lt.(jg), USNR\nWednesday 1 July 1970, at Philadelphia, PA\n\n 00:00  Moored port side to Pier #1 Philadelphia Naval Shipyard with standard mooring lines doubled. USS Ely (PCE-880), is moored outboard. USS Portage (PCE-902) and USS Whitehall (PCE-856) are moored ahead. Other ships present include miscellaneous vessels of the US Atlantic Fleet. SOPA (senior officer present afloat) is Commanding Officer USS Lowry (DO-770). \n 07:45  Mustered the crew at quarters. Absentees: none\n 10:00  Commenced decommissioning ceremony\n 10:05  Colors hauled down and watch secured. Custody of USS Havre (PCE-877) transferred to Commanding Officer, Inactive Ships Maintenance Facility, Philadelphia\n Decommissioned. The USS Havre (PCE-877) was thus struck from the US Navy roster of ships on 1 July 1970.\n\nThe final fate of the USS Havre (PCE-877) is unknown. Several of the other ships in her final task unit lived longer in the commercial world:\n The USS Portage (PCE-902), the Havre's sister ship in Illinois, was renamed the Atlantic Venture and served commercial fisheries in Virginia\n The USS Ely (PCE-880), launched ten weeks after PCE-877 from the same Albina Engine & Machine Works, Portland, Oregon, was sold to the state of Maine as a research vessel, and also was owned by companies in Delaware and Louisiana, before also joining the PCE-902 and being renamed Atlantic Mist. It was sunk 16 January 2010 as part of an artificial reef outside of the Delaware Bay.\n The USS Whitehall (PCE-856) was converted to a tug in 1974, ended up in Virginia with the PCE-902, renamed Atlantic Shore, and was last seen in Louisiana - fate unknown\n\nDecorations\n\nThe PCE-877 received the following awards during her career:\n\nAsiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with two battle stars (for its performance at the Battle of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa)\nWorld War II Victory Medal\nNavy Occupation Medal\nNational Defense Service Medal with star\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Naval History and Heritage Command\n NavSource Online: Patrol Craft Escort Photo Archive\n Dictionary of American Fighting Ships\n Naval History and Heritage Command - Naval Subjects Collection\n NavyHistory.com\n Bowling Green State University - Historical Collections of the Great Lakes\n U.S. Naval Institute\n\n1943 ships\nPCE-842-class patrol craft"}

{"eng_Latn":"James David Martin (born December 11, 1971) is an American serial killer who strangled three people across three states between 1989 and 2005. While serving a sentence for the murder of his wife in Pennsylvania, he was connected via DNA profiling to a cold case murder in The Bronx, for which he was later given an additional 20 years imprisonment.\n\nEarly life\nLittle is known about Martin's early life. According to the detectives who interviewed him, when he was about six years old, his mother beat his little sister to death. Following this event, James was sent to live in Fort Meade, Maryland,with his grandmother and sister and brother where he attended Meade Senior High School. While a student there, he was on the basketball team, where he got acquainted with 15-year-old Michael Eugene Thomas, who would become his best friend and later become his first victim.\n\nMurders\nAt age 17, Martin was envious that his fellow basketball buddy Thomas had recently bought himself an expensive pair of Air Jordans worth $115.50. On May 2, 1989, James lured Michael into the woods near the school, where he proceeded to sodomize and then strangle him to death. After killing him, he stole the Air Jordans and fled the scene. Not long after, however, he was arrested for the murder, charged with first-degree murder and convicted. The senseless crime for the shoes, which ironically did not even fit Martin, were featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated, with professional basketball player Michael Jordan himself expressing his horror at the brutality of the crime. Martin served seven years in prison, before being released in 1996 and moving back to New York City to live with his mother.\n\nOn February 23, 1998, while walking around the Bronx, Martin came across 14-year-old Marleny Cruz, a Dominican-born adoptee who often went on visits to an aunt in the area. Taking an interest in the beautiful young girl, James asked her out on a date to his mother's apartment, to which she agreed. At some point, however, the pair began arguing, with Martin proceeding to grab her by the throat, beating, sexually abusing and finally, strangling Cruz to death. He then dumped her body on a curb in University Heights, where she was later found by passers-by. Initially, she could not be identified, and it was even presumed that she could have been Chante Smalls, a girl who had recently gone missing, but it was later determined not to be the case, as Smalls was later found alive. Eight months later, through dental records, the body was identified as that of Cruz, but her killer remained elusive. Some detectives theorized that her death might have been related to a series of rapes that occurred in the Bronx at the time, but no conclusive connection was made to any such case.\n\nFive months after the Cruz murder, Martin was arrested for groping a junkie and possession of crack cocaine. He was jailed for a year and then released. Not long after, he lured a 17-year-old male relative on a rooftop in the Bronx, where he attempted to strangle the boy with the laces from his sweatpants. The relative lapsed into unconsciousness, with Martin stabbing him in the neck with a knife, stealing $30 and then fleeing. Miraculously, the boy survived his injuries and managed to reach a hospital. When he was visited by his family, he pleaded with them not to let James in, as he was sure he would \"finish [him] off.\" At that moment, James walked in, and although he was arrested on the spot, he was allowed to plead guilty to attempted robbery and sentenced to five years imprisonment.\n\nWhile in prison, he communicated with 30-year-old Cicela Santiago, who would become his girlfriend and later, his wife. After his release, the couple moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania, where, three months later, he strangled Cicela to death after she threatened to leave him. Martin dumped her body in a parking lot trash bin near the mall, where she was soon found.\n\nArrest, trial and imprisonment\nMartin was swiftly arrested following the discovery of his wife's body, pleading guilty and receiving a sentence of 22-to-44 years imprisonment, which he would serve at the State Correctional Institution \u2013 Somerset prison. While serving his sentence there, his DNA was matched to that of an unidentified male's found underneath the fingernails of Marleny Cruz, and detectives from the Bronx were dispatched to question him. He freely admitted his guilt in the murder, and extradited back to New York City to stand trial on charges of murder, rape and sodomy. On October 28, 2016, James David Martin plead guilty to her murder, and received an additional 20 years imprisonment, to be served on top of his previous sentence.\n\nBibliography\n\nReferences\n\n1971 births\n20th-century American criminals\n21st-century American criminals\nAmerican people convicted of murder\nAmerican serial killers\nCriminals from New York (state)\nLiving people\nMinors convicted of murder\nPeople convicted of murder by Maryland\nPeople convicted of murder by New York (state)\nPeople convicted of murder by Pennsylvania\nPeople from the Bronx\nSerial killers from Maryland\nSerial killers from New York (state)\nSerial killers from Pennsylvania\nUxoricides"}

{"eng_Latn":"Sayyid Abd al-Saheb Naser Nasrallah (; born February 28, 1953) is an Iraqi author, and served as the 40th custodian of the Imam Husayn Shrine from 1992 until 2003.\n\nEarly life and education \nNasrallah was born on February 28, 1953, to Nasser Nasrallah, a servant in the Abbas shrine. He hails from the noble Al Faiz family, and claims agnatic descent from Muhammad's daughter Fatimah and her husband, Ali, the first Shia Imam. He grew up and studied in Karbala, and joined the Baath party in the 1970s. He achieved his bachelor's degree in accounting and business management from the University of Baghdad. He also achieved a diploma in political economy science from the Institute of Youth.\n\nCustodianship\n\nAppointment \nAfter the 1991 uprising, Adel al-Killidar had abandoned the  of the Husayn shrine, having fled to Baghdad, whilst the  of the Abbas shrine, Muhammad-Husayn Dhiya al-Din, had been dismissed due to his support of the rebels. Hence, this left both shrines vacant of a custodian, and so at first the Baathists assigned Mehdi al-Ghirabi as the saden of the Abbas shrine. This however, did not go well with the people of the city, as al-Ghirabi was neither from a noble Karbalaei family or one that had a history in serving in the shrines, in fact he wasn't even from Karbala. Furthermore, the names that were nominated for custodianship for the Husayn shrine included Sheikh Abd al-Latif al-Darmi and Sayyid Yusuf al-Wajidi, which again were nominees that had no relationship or history with the shrines or the city. This led a number of the city's dignitaries to meet with the mayor, Abd al-Khaliq Abd al-Aziz, and nominate Nasrallah. This went well with the mayor, since Nasrallah fulfilled the sidana requirements, and was a member of the party. So on March 19, 1992, he was assigned as the saden of the Husayn shrine.\n\nAccomplishments \nSome of the notable accomplishments that occurred under Nasrallah's custodianship included:\n\n The remake of the cage of Ibrahim al-Mujab's shrine, after it was destroyed during the uprising. It was unveiled to the public on October 1, 1992.\n The maintenance of the cage of Habib ibn Madhahir's shrine, after it was damaged during the uprising. It was completed in 1993.\n The fencing of the outer inner precinct of the shrine with a silver window and red marble pillars. It was completed in 1993.\n The gilding of the balcony that encircles the upper sections of the minarets. It was completed in 1994.\n Converting the Leader of the 1920 Revolution graveyard into the shrines ceremonial hall in 1996.\n The Bayn al-Haramayn regeneration programme\u2013after it was desecrated during the 1991 uprising\u2013removing all concrete damns, laying a concrete floor, and planting palm trees across the area. The project was completed in 1997.\n Creating a golden door inside the shrine, made exclusively by Iraqi hands, for the first time in the history of the shrine. The door was completed on January 4, 1999.\n Expanding the shrine of the martyrs of Karbala, and creating a second window for it in the southern rawaq (hallway). This project was done without the knowledge of the authorities, since they were against the idea, however Nasrallah was adamant on the expansion for a number of reasons, so he directed the Najafi gilder, Majid Abu al-Nawair and the Karbalaei architect Hassan al-Memar, and together they worked on the expansion and completed it on August 8, 2000.\n The initiation of the University of Karbala project, and Nasrallah using his influence, along with a number of other noblemen of Karbala, to gather funds to establish the university in 2002.\n\nArbaeen Pilgrimage 1996 \nIn addition to the damage the city took after the uprising, the city was struck by a strong wave of depression. Nasrallah met numerously with the newly assigned mayor, Saber al-Douri, to discuss opening way for pilgrims to visit the Husayn shrine on Arbaeen, using the city's depleted situation as an excuse. Nasrallah's encounters brought results, and al-Douri managed to get permission from higher authority, to allow a large pilgrimage take place in the city. On July 6, 1996, which coincided with the 20th of Safar that year, Karbala witnessed a large gathering of approximately seven million pilgrims. This ease lasted for a while under al-Douri, however by 2000, restrictions for pilgrims returned, and were harsher.\n\nU.S. Invasion \nHe served as custodian up until the 2003 invasion of Iraq. After Karbala was captured by U.S forces on April 5, 2003, he fled to Pakistan, then to Iran where he settled for a while, to avoid clashes with his countrymen who were frustrated at the time with the Baath and anyone affiliated with them.\n\nReturn to Iraq \nHe returned to Iraq in 2011, but was met with mixed sentiments by the people of his city, as well as his family. This was due to the fact that some believed, as a Baathist, he was notorious, whilst others believed he was only fulfilling a position that was deemed to be occupied, and while he did serve the regime, he did provide ease for the Karbalaeis as well as the pilgrims of the holy city. However, a fifth cousin of his, Aref Nasrallah believed in the former, and used his influence to bar him from returning to his hometown (Karbala), so Nasrallah settled in Baghdad.\n\nEver since his dismissal from the sidana, Nasrallah has been occupied with writing books, and has produced a number of publications on the history, culture, and literacy of Islam and Karbala.\n\nWorks\n\nBooks \n\n Tarikh Karbala (History of Karbala). 8 volumes.\n Buyutat Karbala al-Qadima (Old Houses of Karbala).\n Tarikh al-Sidana al-Husayniya wal-Abbasiya (History of the Custodianship of the Husayn and Abbas Shrines).\n Tadhhiya wal-Ramz (Sacrifice and Symbolism).\n al-Hawadith wal-Waqa'i Fi Tarikh Karbala (Events and Chronicles in the History of Karbala).\n Karbala: al-Tarikh wal-Qadasah (Karbala: History and Sanctity).\n Karbala Fi Adab al-Rahlat (Karbala in the Literature of Travellers).\n Hadithat al-Zarka wal-Harakat al-Mahdawiya Fi al-Iraq (The Zarka Incident and the Mahdawi Movements in Iraq).\n\nSee also \n\n Imam Husayn Shrine\n Al Faiz family\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n Library of Nasrallah's books by al-Feker E-book Network (in Arabic)\n\nPeople from Karbala\nLiving people\n1953 births\nCustodian of the Imam Husayn Shrine\nIraqi writers\n20th-century Iraqi people"}

Bunnell, an American, found \"a distinctly English sense of punctuation that sounds awkward to American ears.\" Bunnell also criticized the book's lack of organization, noting that illustrations were often several pages away from the accompanying text.

Unraced as juvenile she finished third on her racecourse debut in 2019 but then won three minor races before the end of the year. As a four-year-old in 2020 she emerged as a top-class performer, winning the Snowdrop Fillies' Stakes, Duchess of Cambridge Stakes, Falmouth Stakes and Sun Chariot Stakes.\n\nBackground\nNazeef is a bay filly with no white markings bred in England by her owner Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Estate. She was sent into training with John Gosden at the Clarehaven Stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. She has been ridden in most of her races by Jim Crowley.\n\nShe was sired by the Haydock Sprint Cup winner Invincible Spirit, who has produced many other major winners including Kingman, Charm Spirit, Mayson, Fleeting Spirit, Moonlight Cloud, Magna Grecia and Lawman. Nazeef's dam Handassa was bought by Shadwell as a yearling for 100,000 guineas and became a successful racemare, winning two races including the Listed Garnet Stakes. Handassa's dam Starstone was a half-sister to the leading sprinters Pastoral Pursuits and Goodricke.\n\nRacing career\n\n2019: three-year-old season\nNazeef did not run as a two-year-old and made her racecourse debut in a minor race over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 8 June 2019 in which she was ridden by Nicky Mackay and finished third behind Nonchalance and Flarepath, beaten five and a quarter lengths by the winner. Nineteen days later she started 4\/6 favourite for a seven-runner maiden race over the same course and distance and recorded her first success as she took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by one and a quarter lengths from the four-year-old gelding Ghalyoon. On 4 September the filly started at odds of 1\/4 for a novice race (for horses with no more than two previous wins) over one mile on the synthetic Polytrack surface at Chelmsford City Racecourse and won \"very easily\" after accelerating away from her three opponents in the final furlong. For her final run of the season, Nazeef was returned to the turf for a handicap race over one mile at Newmarket three weeks later in which she carried top weight of 134 pounds and started 6\/4 favourite. Ridden by Dane O'Neill she took the lead inside the last quarter mile and won in \"impressive\" style by six lengths from Salayel.\n\n2020: four-year-old season\nFor her first run of 2020 Nazeef was stepped up in class to contest the Listed Snowdrop Fillies' Stakes over one mile on Polytrack at Kempton Park Racecourse. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic the British flat-racing season was restructured leading to the race being run behind closed doors on 3 June (rather than its usual date in April) and being open to three-year-olds. Nazeef started the 4\/1 third choice in the betting behind her stablemate Scentasia (winner of the Fleur De Lys Fillies' Stakes and the Gillies Fillies' Stakes) and Billesdon Brook. After being restrained by Crowley for most of the way she made strong progress on the outside in the straight, overtook Billesdon Brook in the closing stages and won \"cosily\" by three quarters of a length. John Gosden's son Thady said \"it was a very pleasing performance... she has strengthened and matured nicely this year. Hopefully she will continue to improve\" while Crowley commented \"She has done nothing but improve with every run she has had in the last year and she keeps getting better and better\".\n\nThirteen days after her win at Kempton Nazeef was moved up to Group 2 class for the Duke of Cambridge Stakes at Royal Ascot and started the 100\/30 third choice behind the joint-favourites Queen Power (Fillies' Trial Stakes) and Jubiloso. The best fancied of the other seven runners was the Godolphin entry Magic Lily who had won the Balanchine and the Cape Verdi in Dubai. Nazeef raced in mid-division before staying on strongly in the last quarter mile and gained the advantage in the final strides to win by a head from the 28\/1 outsider Agincourt. John Gosden commented \"Nazeef is very genuine and did nothing but improve last year. She deserves a little rest... We won't rush her back but you'd love to see her have a go at a Group 1\".\n\nNazeef contested her first Group 1 race on 10 July when she started at odds of 9\/2 for the Falmouth Stakes over one mile at Newmarket. Her stablemate Terebellum (winner of the Prix de la Nonette and Dahlia Stakes and runner-up in the Queen Anne Stakes) started favourite while the other four contenders were Billesdon Brook, One Master, Agincourt and Under The Stars (Eternal Stakes). After racing in second place behind Terbellum, Nazeef stayed on strongly in the final furlong and won in a blanket finish by a neck from Billesdon Brook with Terebellum the same distance away in third, half a length in front of One Master. After the race Crowley said \"She's as tough as nails and she's improved with every run. That's six races in a row she's won now - she's climbed her way up the ladder. She's a really gorgeous looking filly as well, with plenty of size and scope about her\".\n\nThree weeks after her win at Newmarket, Nazeef went off the 100\/30 second favourite for the Group 1 Nassau Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse. She stayed on well in the closing stages but never looked likely to win and came home third behind the Irish-trained three-year-olds Fancy Blue and One Voice. On 23 August the filly was sent to France for the Prix Jean Romanet over 2000 metres at Deauville Racecourse and started the 0.7\/1 favourite but after being in close contention for most of the way she faded badly in the closing stages and finished ninth of the eleven runners behind Audarya. In the Sun Chariot Stakes over one mile on heavy ground at Newmarket on 3 October Nazeef was ridden by Crowley and started the 17\/2 third choice in the betting behind Champers Elysees and Peaceful in a twelve-runner field which also included Veracious, Terebellum, Billesdon Brook, Feliciana De Vega (Darley Stakes), Half Light (Hamburger Stutenmeile) and Cloak of Spirits (second in the 1000 Guineas). Nazeef raced up the stands side (the left hand side from the jockeys' perspective) and settled just behind the leaders as Veracious set the pace from Cloak of Spirits. She made steady progress to deprive Cloak of Spirits of the lead a furlong out and kept on well to win by one and a half lengths from Half Light. John Gosden said \"You never expect that you're going to go from Chelmsford handicaps to knocking off two group 1 races at Newmarket, do you? But she's a willing filly and she's quite lazy in her work and looks after herself. She's not one who looks to overdo it, and I think that's a big factor in her progression. She's a grand filly, very brave... It's been a fantastic year for her\".\n\nOn her final run of the season Nazeef started at odds of 10\/1 the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on heavy ground at Ascot on 17 October. She tracked the leaders before tiring in the last quarter mile and coming home eighth of the fourteen runners behind The Revenant.\n\nPedigree\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Career 1-2-3 Colour Chart \u2013 Nazeef\n\n2016 racehorse births\nRacehorses bred in the United Kingdom\nRacehorses trained in the United Kingdom\nThoroughbred family 14-f"}

{"eng_Latn":"J\u00f3zef Pieter (19 February 1904 in Ochaby \u2013 3 March 1989) was a Polish psychologist, philosopher, pedagogue, researcher, and lecturer.\n\nPr. Pieter dedicated his life and work to the study of the psychology and mechanisms of teaching and learning, the comparison of pedagogical systems, the process of reasoning and the methodology and organisation of scientific work.\n\nPr. Pieter earned his PhD at the Jagiellonian University and passed his habilitation at the University of Pozna\u0144. Pr. Pieter is the author of over 230 scientific publications.\n\nEducation \nBorn in Ochaby, the country side of Cieszyn, in South Western Poland, Pr. J. Pieter studied history, philosophy, psychology and pedagogy at the Jagellonian University of Cracow. He earned his PhD in Philosophy and Classical Philology from this institution in 1928. He later received his habilitation from the University of Poznan in 1945.\n\nAcademic Life and Functions \nPr. J. Pieter was the Chair of Psychology at the University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, University of Warsaw and Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego (AWF) in Warsaw.

J. Pieter is also known as a founding father of the University of Silesia. As early as 1929, he published a manifesto calling upon its creation, that would only happen in 1968 (\" Thoughts on the Organisation of Scientific Work and Research in Silesia \").\n\nDuring World War Two, Pr. J. Pieter was an active participant in the Underground Education System that allowed students to follow a school and university curriculum during the war.\n\nThe early encounter with psychology,\u00a0 and the field of pedagogy in particular, cannot be dissociated from the even earlier encounter with nature that Pr. J. Pieter studied throughout his life in the specific fields of Botanics and Physical Geography, leading him to become a vocal speaker for the preservation of natural areas and landscape. He also had a well known fascination for the mountains and in particular his local Beskidy.\n\nPsychology of Pedagogy and Learning \nPr. Jozef Pieter is the author of over 230 scientific publications, amongst which 50 books, in the fields of :\n\nPsychology : psychology of teaching and learning, psychology of knowledge and science, intellectual thought process, psychobiography, behavioral psychology, history of psychology, psychology of philosophy\n\nPedagogy : history of pedagogy, sociology of education, pedagogy as a science, methodology, organisation of education, technical and scientific education, self education, scientific controversies.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHe married Aldona Herwa in 1936.

J. Pieter's memory is honored in various locations in Katowice and Silesia.\n\nA roundabout bears his name in the vicinity of the University of Silesia. At the University of Silesia in Katowice, a memorial plaque is located on the front of the Institute of Chemistry, ul. Szolna 9, while his bust sits at the entrance of the hall that bears his name in the Department of Pedagogy and Psychology. Both are works by Silesian sculptor Zygmunt Brachma\u0144ski.\n\nIn Skocz\u00f3w, a sculpture by Jerzy Fober was inaugurated in 2016. In his native Ochaby, stands another bust by Zygmunt Brachma\u0144ski.\n\nIn 2011, his son, Jacek Pieter, set up in Katowice a not-for-profit foundation in recognition of his father's intellectual legacy and engagements. It seeks to promote freedom of thought and creation through education centered on the pleasure of learning.\n\nBooks \nPsychologia \u015bwiatopogl\u0105du m\u0142odzie\u017cy (1933)\nBiografia og\u00f3lna (1946)\nPsychologia jako nauka (1947)\nKrytyka dzie\u0142 tw\u00f3rczych (1948)\nHistoria psychologii (1958\u22121974)\nCzytanie i lektura (1960)\nS\u0142ownik psychologiczny (1963)\nWst\u0119p do nauki o osobowo\u015bci (1969)\nOg\u00f3lna metodologia pracy naukowej (1967)\nPsychologia uczenia si\u0119 i nauczania (1970)\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n Zbigniew Hojka: J\u00f3zef Pieter \u2013 pedagog, psycholog, organizator szkolnictwa wy\u017cszego na G\u00f3rnym \u015al\u0105sku. \"Kwartalnik Historii Nauki i Techniki\" 2020.

{"eng_Latn":"The Other Shoe is a 2001 Canadian short experimental film by video artist Daniel Cockburn, his third, which, along with Metronome (2002), earned a mention for the Homebrew Award when shown at the Images Festival and thereby broadened his reputation beyond Toronto.\n\nThemes\n\nTime in the cinema\nThe main theme of The Other Shoe is the cinematic perception of time, which is compressed or elongated into a singular experience, for which insight Cockburn acknowledges Andrei Tarkovsky. Cockburn remarks that the contemporary trend in cinema is speed and diversion, except in advertising where one finds many static shots: \"We have learned that slowness can be appreciated, but only briefly; slownesses thus follow one another with great rapidity, as refreshing as ice cubes shooting out of a volcano.\" Cockburn is convinced that \"longer attention span means greater capability of complex thought, means greater empowerment\", adding that he is not fixated on \"slowness\" and that there are other means of foregrounding time, which he does with rhythm in Metronome and Stupid Coalescing Becomers, a \"backwards time fantasy\".\n\nMedia and multitasking\nCockburn was surprised to find that the finished film was as much about hypertext and multitasking as it was about his original intentions. According to the LIFT programme, The Other Shoe \"straddles the line between media, questioning its validity on either side.\" The short engages its viewers in \"the conflict between contemplation and multitasking,\" while trying to avoid \"shoot[ing] itself in the foot.\"\n\nProduction\nThe short film was Daniel Cockburn's third following Doctor Virtuous (1999) and Rocket Man (2000). It was also his first widescreen motion picture.\n\nCommission\nThe Other Shoe was a commission for the 20th anniversary of LIFT (The Liaison of Independent Filmmakers of Toronto). Cockburn was one of fifteen film and video artists given cash and equipment to create short works \"that would be personal responses\" to the theme Self & Celluloid: The Future. Cockburn has long had technophobic tendencies, in particular of digital video as a medium, and has claimed to have created The Other Shoe \"solely in dismayed response\" to his discovery that the commissioned works of which The Other Shoe was a part would be streamed online: \"That may be fine for some people, I thought \u2014 without (much) prejudice \u2014 but not for those of us who still relish the surrender of darkened-theatre viewing.\"\n\nFilming and editing\nThe director's solution to the anxieties created for him by the live-streaming aspect of the project was to make a double projection of both 16 mm film and video, with the video portion designed to be streamed on the internet, while the film portion could only be seen by the audience who attended the screening, a practice which Cockburn later called \"simplistic film fetishism\" on his part.\n\nCockburn's method for achieving \"slowness\" was to place single takes in a mutli-frame context, something he did again in The Impostor (hello goodbye). Looking back a few years later, he said these portions of The Other Shoe were some of the relatively few shots he had ever made that he found \"really aesthetically pleasing.\"\n\nRelease and reception\nAs part of the LIFT 20th Anniversary programme, The Other Shoe premiered in Toronto in 2001 and toured Canada through 2002.\n\nCritical and audience response\nStephen Lan saw the short at the Images Festival in April 2002, calling it \"thoughtful and philosophical... clever and witty.\" Response to The Other Shoe surprised Cockburn, who wrote in October 2001 that he derived a \"humbling joy\" from knowing that a work made with his \"simple-minded\" intentions could, in \"failing to fully make its point,\" nevertheless be \"engagingly conflicted and complex\".\n\nAccolade\nImages Festival, honorable mention for the Homebrew Award (Best Local Emerging Artist) jointly with Metronome, 2002\n\nRelated work\nmonopedal Joy (2001)\nCockburn made use of outtakes to create the short music video monopedal Joy, a 16\u00a0mm projection captured and edited in camera on Mini DV and subsequently mastered to Betacam.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nThe Other Shoe on CCCA\n\nFilms directed by Daniel Cockburn\n2000s English-language films\nCanadian avant-garde and experimental short films\n2000s Canadian films"}

{"eng_Latn":"Music and sleep involves the listening of music in order to improve sleep quality or improve sleep onset insomnia in adults (for infant use of music and sleep, see lullaby). This process can be either self-prescribed or under the guidance of a music therapist. Music is easy to administer and has no reported side effects. Music can be combined with relaxation techniques such as breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation. Research suggests that prevalence of music as a sleep aid may be up to 25% in the general population.\n\nMajor empirical findings \nResearch indicates that music may improve subjective sleep quality in adults with sleep problems. However, findings are less consistent with improving sleep quality of 'normal' sleepers. In direct comparisons, music has improved sleep quality greater than audiobooks and has been comparable to sedative hypnotics. One review of non-pharmacological sleep aids identified music as the only sleep aid with adequate research.\n\nMechanisms\n\nDickson & Schubert's RPR \nDickson & Schubert summarized and evaluated six researcher proposed reasons (RPR) by which music could potentially aid sleep:\n\n Entrainment: 'synchronization of biological rhythms to beat structures in music.'\n Masking: 'obscuring noxious background noise with music.'\n Enjoyment: 'listening to preferred, emotionally relatable or pleasant music.'\n Distraction: 'where music acts as a focal point to distract from inner stressful thoughts.'\n Expectation: 'individuals cultural beliefs around music.'\n Relaxation: 'where music encourages physiological or psychological relaxation.'\n\nHabit formation \nDickson & Schubert proposed Habit Formation as an additional RPR under the Arts on Prescription model. Music requires a minimum of three weeks for individuals suffering mild insomnia to become healthy sleepers and continues to improve sleep quality over three months. Music improved sleep quality with increased exposure regardless of differences in the demographic, music genre, duration of treatment, and exposure frequency.\nDickson suggests to \"listen to music that you find relaxing, at the same time, every night for at least three weeks\".\n\nMusical genres and features \nTypical genres of music used for sleep (sedative music) include classical music, ethnic music, ambient music, meditation music and lullabies. Although researchers have recognised a wide diversity of music genres aiding sleep.  The characteristics of music that have improved sleep quality in the music-sleep literature include slow tempo, small change of rhythm, and moderate pitch variation of melody. The selection of music (self selected or researcher selected) does not appear to impact sleep quality.\n\nSedative music developed in collaboration with researchers \n Can't Sleep (app) - Gaelen Thomas Dickson (music psychology)\n Pzizz (app) - Maryanne Garry (psychology)\n Marconi Union - Weightless (song) - Lyz Cooper (sound therapy)\n Max Richter - Sleep (album) - David Eagleman (neuroscience)\n\nSee also \n Long Ambients 1: Calm.

{"eng_Latn":"Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus was a consular tribune of the Roman republic in 438, 425, 420 BC and possibly consul in 428 BC.\n\nQuinctius belonged to the powerful Quinctia gens and was the son of one of the early republic's most famous figures, the twice appointed dictator Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus. He was probably the elder brother of Titus Quinctius Poenus Cincinnatus, consul in 431 BC. Filiations indicate that he was the father of Quintus Quinctius Cincinnatus, consular tribune in 415 BC, and possibly a Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus who was father to Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, consular tribune in 386, 385 and 377 BC.\n\nCareer \nQuinctius was elected consular tribune in 438 BC together with Mamercus Aemilius Mamercinus and Lucius Julius Iullus. They continued hostilities against the Fidenates and their leader Lars Tolumnius, which would result in the death of four Roman legates sent as ambassadors. The four legates, Gaius Fulcinius, Cloelius Tullus, Spurius Antius and Lucius Roscius, would later be honoured with statues on the Rostra.\n\nIn the following year, the war with the Fidenates was escalated and a dictator was appointed to handle the crisis. The dictator was the former consular colleague of Quinctius, Mamercus Aemilius Mamercinus. Aemilius selected Quinctius to be his second-in-command as magister equitum. They fought and defeated the Veii, Falerii and Fidenae, and Aemilius was granted a triumph.\n\nIn 428 or 427 BC Quinctius held the consulship together with Aulus Sempronius Atratinus. This consulship is dubious as it is only mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and is placed in between the consuls of 428 BC, Aulus Cornelius Cossus and Titus Quinctius Poenus Cincinnatus, and the consuls of 427 BC, Gaius Servilius Structus Ahala and Lucius Papirius Mugillanus.  It is possible that they were suffect consuls replacing the college of 428 BC or that all four consuls mentioned in 428 BC were consular tribunes.  All events described by other ancient authors are ascribed to the ordinary consuls of 428 BC.\n\nQuinctius was re-elected as consular tribune in 425 BC together with Aulus Sempronius Atratinus, Lucius Furius Medullinus and Lucius Horatius Barbatus. They oversaw the signing of a twenty year truce with Veii and a three year truce with the Aequi.\n\nQuinctius, or his brother Titus, was elected as consular tribune in 420 BC. Livy and the Chronograph of 354 has Lucius Quinctius, while the Fasti Capitolini points towards Titus. Scholars generally favour Lucius Quinctius as the consular tribune of 420 BC and that the Fasti has confused the two brothers. The college, including Quinctius, consisted of two of his former colleagues from 425, Furius and Sempronius, and a consular newcomer, Marcus Manlius Vulso. Little is known about the events of the year other than that Sempronius presided over the election of the Quaestors.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences \n\nRoman consular tribunes\n5th-century BC Romans"}

The format of English Soccer was similar in that to BBC's Match of the Day, where the majority of the highlights were focused on the biggest game of the week, and a shorter amount of time was given to showing the goal highlights from the other matches.\n\nSince 1992\n\nSportsChannel America and Prime Network (1992-1996)\nPrime Network was one of the first media companies to purchase the US rights to overseas soccer leagues. When the Premier League officially launched in August 1992, Prime provided a match of the week on a delayed basis. The matches were also edited and condensed to 90 minutes (with commercial breaks). Meanwhile, around this same time, SportsChannel America aired a 1-hour weekly highlights package on Friday nights.\n\nPrime Network later provided live coverage of the 1995 English FA Cup Final (Everton-Manchester United), with JP Dellacamera and Ty Keough hosting the pre-game, half-time, and post-game \"wraps\" from Houston's Liberty SportsComm studio.\n\nESPN (1996\u20131998; 2009\u20132013)\n\nESPN2 formerly aired matches from the Premier League between 1996\u20131998, and then from 2009\u20132013. On tape delay in 1981, ESPN had initially shown select games. From 2010\u20132013, ESPN2 had its own commentary team of Ian Darke and Steve McManaman, with Darrell Currie, Dave Beckett, or Alicia Ferguson reporting pitchside live in England. On occasion, the network would simulcast ESPN UK's coverage with full studio coverage from host Ray Stubbs or Rebecca Lowe and commentary from Jon Champion and Chris Waddle. In the U.S., ESPN's studio team was host Andrew Orsatti or Georgie Bingham with analyst Robbie Mustoe.\n\nFox Sports (1998\u20132013)\n\nFox Soccer aired the English Premier League from 1998\u20132013. At the start of the season, Fox Sports Net or Fox Sports World broadcast weekly highlights from Premier League matches, with Lionel Bienvenu hosting the show. Meanwhile, the live match broadcast is broadcast on a pay-per-view basis through several providers. Later, Fox Soccer aired live and tape-delayed matches each week, plus weekly magazine (Premier League World), preview (Premier League Preview Show, and Matchday) and recap (Premier League Review and Goals on Sunday) shows. Besides matches on Fox Soccer, Fox Deportes and Fox Soccer Plus, up to 3 matches each season were available live free-to-air on Fox. Up to 74 matches each season were sublicensed to ESPN, Inc. Contract ran through May 2013, at which point coverage went to NBC Sports\/NBCSN to the present day. In the later years of their coverage, Fox had a studio pregame show first hosted by Christian Miles until 2011, then by Rob Stone. Studio analysts were Warren Barton, Eric Wynalda, Brian McBride, and Keith Costigan. Commentary was provided by former corporate sibling Sky Sports.\n\nAmerica One syndicated many of these broadcasts to various regional sports networks in the US (usually, those not part of the Fox Sports Net family). America One also carried tape-delayed broadcasts of the English Premier League, specifically Bolton Wanderers and Everton.\n\nNBC Sports (2013-present)\n\nNBC acquired rights to the Premier League in 2013, replacing Fox Sports and ESPN. NBC's studio programming for the league includes the pre-match show Premier League Live, and the highlights shows Premier League Goal Zone and Match of the Day (modeled upon the similar BBC series). NBC Sports president of programming Jon Miller explained that their main goal was to not \"Americanize\" their coverage (besides providing explanations of terminology unfamiliar to U.S. viewers, such as derbies), citing their decision to employ talent (such as former ESPN UK and BBC Sport presenter Rebecca Lowe, who became NBC's lead host) who \"know the Premier League and can talk about it intelligently\". In 2014, NBC also hired the duo of Michael Davies and Roger Bennett\u2014the \"Men in Blazers\"\u2014to provide soccer-oriented content across NBC Sports' platforms. NBC renewed its Premier League rights in 2021, extending its contract until the end of the 2027-28 season.\n\nDuring larger matchdays, NBCSN operates pop-up channels branded as Premier League Extra Time, which broadcast overflow matches not shown by other NBC networks. However in 2017, NBC began to paywall many of these overflow games behind the \"Premier League Pass\" service on NBC Sports Gold. Premier League Pass was in turn phased out in 2020, with its Premier League content transferred to the newly launched Peacock streaming service; Premier League games broadcast on the main NBC network would be simulcast on the service starting the next year. On Survival Sunday, the majority of NBCUniversal's cable networks carry games, including several networks not normally dedicated to sports.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nHistory of Premier League televised on US TV\nRemember English Div 1 matches on PBS?\n\nUnited States television\nESPN2\nESPN\nNBC Sports\nNBCSN\nFox Sports\nPrime Sports\nSportsChannel\nSports programming on PBS\nHistory of sports broadcasting\nSoccer on United States television"}

{"eng_Latn":"Marjorie Linklater ( MacIntyre; 19 March 1909 \u2013 29 June 1997) was a Scottish campaigner for the arts and environment on the island of Orkney. She gave up acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art to get involved in conservation, education, and health matters as a county councillor for Ross and Cromarty County Council. In 1975, Linklater was elected chairman of the Orkney Heritage Society, devoting herself to campaigning for the arts environment, local heritage, and politics. She successfully opposed the mining of uranium and the dumping of nuclear waste off Orkney's west coast and was a founding member of the St Magnus Festival. The Orkney Heritage Society named a senior school award in Linklater's honour following her death.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\nLinklater was born to Scottish international rugby player and future Unionist Party MP Ian MacIntyre and his first wife Ida Van der Gucht on 19 March 1909 at 19 Northumberland Street, Edinburgh. She was one of six children in the family. Linklater was educated sparsely at St George's School, Edinburgh and Downe House School, Berkshire, before enrolling at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She played a number of minor roles in the West End theatre scene, but decided she was not suited to be an actress and went back to Edinburgh in 1930.\n\nCareer\n\nBack in Edinburgh, Linklater successfully campaigned with the actor Michael MacOwan for the establishment of the National Theatre of Scotland, and had a role in the local community, producing winning plays in drama festivals and played the cello in an orchestra. After moving to Easter Ross in 1947 from living in Orkney since 1933, she became a county councillor of Ross and Cromarty County Council in 1953, getting involved conservation, education, and health matters. Linklater helped to found a secondary school in the Gaelic-speaking fishing village of Plockton, meaning children did not need to travel long distances for their education. She secured the post of headteacher at the school for the Gaelic poet Sorley MacLean, and was successful in having public lavatories built-in popular tourist locations, earning her the nickname \"Ross-shire's lavatory queen\". Linklater also served as a member of the Scottish Arts Council from 1957 to 1963, the Inverness Hospital Board, the Advisory Council of the Highlands and Islands Development Board, and the Council of European Architectural Heritage Year.\n\nIn 1975, she returned to Orkney, saying in an interview \"I have decided to give up sex and take up committees.\" Linklater was elected chairman of the Orkney Heritage Society in 1976, and immediately got involved in a campaign to counter the duo threats of the nuclear sector's plan to mine uranium on Orkney's mainland and dumping nuclear waste off the island's west coast. She followed up by contesting plans to dump nuclear waste at sea, and later successfully convinced the oil industry to fund an qualified resident archaeologist who supervised Orkney's rich prehistoric heritage full-time. In 1976, Linklater and Peter Maxwell Davies among others co-founded the St Magnus Festival, and conceived, performed, and produced the Johnsmas Foy as the festival's primary literary event. In the 1970s, she joined the Scottish National Party (SNP), becoming the Orkney and Shetland's branch chairman and was the agent for Winnie Ewing, the MEP for the Highlands and Islands.\n\nAt age 80, Linklater confronted a farmer who took sand from a beach, causing him to drive his digger towards her and verbally abused her. She said in response \"Well, make up your mind. I can't be both.\" Linklater distributed pamphlets for the SNP, canvassing for the local candidate at the 1992 United Kingdom general election. She worked with Laura Grimond to restore the 8th-century St Boniface Kirk, was a founding trustee and chairperson of the Pier Arts Centre and was a founder member of the Orkney Folk Festival. Linklater also housed the local candidate for the Natural Law Party during the 1997 United Kingdom general election.\n\nPersonal life\n\nShe was a Christian, went to church, and was a Scottish nationalist. Linklater was married to the writer Eric Linklater from 1 June 1933 until his death on 7 November 1974. They had four children (two sons and two daughters): including the biographer and journalist Andro Linklater and the newspaper editor and arts administrator Magnus Linklater. She died of cancer and heart failure on the evening of 29 June 1997 at her home in Kirkwall, Orkney.\n\nLegacy\nIn 2000, the Orkney Heritage Society established The Marjorie Linklater Writing Award in her memory. The award is presented to senior school pupils in the fifth or sixth year of education and to similarly aged students at Orkney College \"for a short piece of creative writing\" with judges including members of the Linklater family.\n\nReferences\n\n1909 births\n1997 deaths\nPeople from Edinburgh\nPeople educated at St George's School, Edinburgh\nPeople educated at Downe House School\nAlumni of RADA\n20th-century Scottish actresses\nCouncillors in Highland (council area)\nScottish environmentalists\nScottish nationalists\nWomen councillors in Scotland\nLinklater family"}

The mountain has a bedrock of granite, and is about  high.\n\nThe mountain has historically gone by a number of other names, including Baegaksan ().\n\nNames \nUntil the Joseon period, the mountain went by a variety of names, including \"Baegaksan\", \"Myeonaksan\" (), and \"Gonggeuksan\" (). However, \"Baegaksan\" was the most popular name during the Joseon period. \n\nThe name \"Bugaksan\", meaning \"north mountain\", became popular just after the Japanese colonial period. Some government offices have made efforts to return to using the \"Baegaksan\" name, in order to strengthen modern South Korea's ties to the pre-Japanese past.\n\nDescription \nThe mountain is part of a range of mountains connected to the south of Bukhansan, the highest mountain in Seoul.\n\nThere are 208 species of plants on the mountain, including 81 species of trees.\n\nThe Cheonggyecheon stream that flows through Seoul originates from the mountain. In November 2005, the Jongno District government investigated the source of the river, and found that it was a mineral water spring about  from a statue of police officer .\n\nHistory \nBeginning in the Joseon period, the mountain was a popular spot for the aristocracy to construct villlas.\n\nAfter the Blue House Raid of January 21, 1968, in which North Korean operatives attempted to assassinate the South Korean president, access to the mountain became heavily restricted. These restrictions began to be lifted on April 1, 2006, when Sukjeongmun was reopened for public access. Beginning on November 1, 2020, a section north of the Blue House was opened to the public. It is now possible to hike from the mountain Ansan, Inwangsan, Bugaksan, and Bukhansan without interruption. There is a number of guided walking courses over the mountain, including one that walks along the Fortress Wall of Seoul.\n\nThe mountain was designated an area of secnic beauty in 2009 by the Cultural Heritage Administration.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\nList of mountains in Seoul\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nMountains of South Korea\nMountains of Seoul"}

{"eng_Latn":"Hard Times is a supplement published by Game Designers' Workshop (GDW) in 1991 for the science fiction role-playing game MegaTraveller.\n\nContents\nHard Times moves the Traveller universe forward into a time where the galaxy is riven by economic stagnation and collapse of the empire. Rick Swan wrote, \"Planets are gasping for life like guppies flung from a fish bowl, and the luckless survivors face a future of staggering adversity.\"\n\nThe book is divided into two main sections:\n An introduction, where gamemasters are advised what adjustments they should make to their MegaTraveller campaigns. This section also includes tables about damage to planetary biospheres, changes to tech levels, and new maps of the Shattered Imperium.\n Most of the book is taken up by a ten-adventure campaign, with each adventure covering one step in the decline and fall of the now-defunct Imperium:\n Destruction of interstellar transport\n Collapse of financial markets\n Economic recession\n Corporate reconfiguration\n Raiders and pirates\n Isolationism\n Retooling hardware\n Dooomed worlds\n The Imperium fails\n The darkness begins\n\nPublication history\nGDW originally published Traveller, one of the first science fiction role-playing games, in 1977. By the late 1980s, despite a number of new editions including MegaTraveller, sales of the once-popular game had fallen off. In the 2014 book Designers & Dragons: The '70s, game historian Shannon Appelcline explained the steps GDW took to try to regenerate interest: \"Dave Nilsen, one of GDW's new hires, headed the final attempts to correct MegaTravellers problems. He began work with Hard Times (1991), a MegaTraveller book by Charles Gannon that moved the Traveller timeline from the year 1122 to 1128. It was an attempt by GDW to start actually moving MegaTravellers metaplot, rather than leaving it in stasis. Though some thought it a great supplement because it did something, others thought that it made the once optimistic background of Traveller brutal and hopeless.\" Appelcline also noted that in preparation for Traveller: The New Era, \"GDW did something very surprising: they destroyed the Imperium. A book called Survival Margin (1993) artfully detailed the transition from MegaTraveller through Hard Times into the New Era in prose form.\n\nHard Times was designed by Charles Gannon, with additional contributions by Terrence McInnes, Tom McCarol, Mark Cunningham, and J. Duncan Law-Green. Interior art was by Thomas Darrel Midgette, Kirk Wescom and Lawrence Williams, and cover art was by David Dorman. The 96-page hardcover book was published by GDW in 1991.\n\nReviews\nIn the July 1992 edition of Dragon (Issue #183), Rick Swan admired the new direction of the MegaTraveller universe, calling it \"a chilling look at the Shattered Imperium in the aftermath of the War of the Rebellion. If the MegaTraveller game heated up the universe of the original Traveller game, Hard Times incinerates it.\" Swan concluded, \"It's fascinating material, masterfully done.\"\n\nReferences\n\nRole-playing game supplements introduced in 1991\nTraveller (role-playing game) supplements"}

{"eng_Latn":"Jan Marsalek (n\u00e9 Mar\u0161\u00e1lek; born 15 March 1980) is an Austrian fugitive businessman. From 2010 to 2020, he was the chief operating officer of German payment processing firm Wirecard, which became insolvent and collapsed in 2020. Marsalek was responsible for the company's business in Asia, where the company admitted nearly \u20ac2 billion in cash it supposedly held did not exist.\n\nMarsalek and the rest of the company's executive team was fired on 18 June 2020, after which he fled Germany. He is reportedly fugitive in Russia after Interpol issued a Red Notice for his arrest due to his alleged role in the Wirecard scandal.\n\nEarly life\nMarsalek went to school in Austria, but did not obtain a degree. Marsalek's grandfather, Hans Mar\u0161\u00e1lek, was a member of the Austrian resistance and later a suspected spy for the Soviet Union. At the age of 19, Marsalek Jr. founded an e-commerce software company.\n\nCareer with Wirecard\nHe started working for Wirecard in 2000 and was initially hired for his knowledge on WAP systems. On 1 February 2010, he became the firm's chief operating officer and also joined the company executive committee.\n\nWirecard scandal\n\nMarsalek and the rest of Wirecard's executive team was fired on 18 June 2020. According to Bellingcat, Marsalek told colleagues he was going to the Philippines to prove his innocence, before going missing. Marsalek is considered a key suspect by German authorities in the Wirecard scandal, in which the company inflated its balance sheet, eventually leading to the company's collapse in 2020.\n\nHis last known residence was in Munich. An investigation by Bellingcat, Der Spiegel and The Insider indicated that Marsalek flew to Minsk, Belarus, hours after he was fired from Wirecard. On 19 July 2020, German newspaper Handelsblatt reported that Marsalek was suspected to be in Russia, where he was believed to live under supervision of the Russian GRU in a mansion near Moscow. According to Die Welt, the BND had information in 2020 that Marsalek was at a Russian FSB training center in Balashikha, a suburb of Moscow.\n\nAt the request of Germany, Interpol issued a red notice for Marsalek in August 2020. The notice is a formal request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and arrest him, pending extradition.\n\nIn May 2021, the German BND assessed that Marselek remained near Moscow. The Russian government claimed it was unaware of Marsalek's location. According to Mikhail Khodorkovsky's Dossier Center, Marsalek received Russian citizenship and had at least two fake Russian passports in 2021. He reportedly lived under FSB protection at the Meyendorff Castle.\n\nAllegations of ties to Russian intelligence\nAs of 2020, Marsalek was a person of interest to at least three Western intelligence agencies due to his associations with the Russian GRU. In Munich, Marsalek lived opposite the Russian consulate. Russian media and Germany's governing coalition reported that Marsalek made contacts with Russian intelligence through the Austrian-Russian Friendship Society. Among his associates were former GRU colonel Andrey Chuprygin. Marsalek reportedly boasted to companions about his trips to Palmyra, Syria, as a \"guest of the Russian military\".\n\nSince 2015, Marsalek reportedly discussed the Libyan crisis with representatives of the Russian government. A company linked to Marsalek by the Financial Times was used by the Wagner Group to stage personnel.\n\nIn September 2023 the trial of five Bulgarian nationals accused of being part of a Russian spying network began in the UK. The prosecution alleges that the network had been given tasking by Jan Marsalek.\n\nSee also\nList of fugitives from justice who disappeared\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Search for Jan Marsalek by the Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)\n Jan Marsalek on Europe's Most Wanted Fugitives list from Europol\n\n1980 births\nFugitives wanted by Germany\nFugitives wanted on fraud charges\nLiving people\nRussian spies"}

{"eng_Latn":"Sophie Grace Chappell (born Timothy David John Chappell; November 1964) is an English philosopher and academic. Since 2006, she has been Professor of Philosophy at the Open University.\n\nEarly life and education\nChappell was born in November 1964. She studied Literae humaniores at Magdalen College, Oxford, having been awarded the Anne Shaw Classical Scholarship. She achieved a first in Honour Moderations in March 1986 and an upper second in the Final Honour School in June 1988, thereby graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. She then moved to the University of Edinburgh to undertake research for a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree under the supervision of James Mackey and Dory Scaltsas. She completed her PhD in 1992 with a thesis titled \"Aristotle and Augustine on voluntary action and freedom and weakness of the will\".\n\nAcademic career\nIn 1991, Chappell returned to the University of Oxford and was a junior research fellow at Wolfson College, Oxford (1991\u20131994) and a lecturer in philosophy at Merton College, Oxford (1992\u20131994). She was then a lecturer at the University of East Anglia from 1994 to 1996 and at the University of Manchester 1996 to 1998. In 1998, she moved to the University of Dundee: she was promoted to senior lecturer in 2002 and to Reader in Philosophy in 2005. In May 2006, she joined the Open University as Professor of Philosophy and director of the Open University Ethics Centre.\n\nThought\nSophie Grace Chappell writes against the systematic ambitions of contemporary moral philosophy to be able to define \"the  whole and exclusive truth about the justification, explanation, evaluation, and prescription of moral beliefs, and to contain the materials for displacing or refuting most or all other systematic moral theories.\"\nHer work aligns with that of her teacher Bernard Williams, as well as Alasdair MacIntyre and Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nShe offers a new definition of the human personhood, inspired by gender role theory. She criticizes the traditional definition of \"man\" and \"woman\"  based on antenatal biological traits, arguing that the sexual forms of human individuals can be used to identify human animals, but not human personhood. This point of view draws upon the Aristotelian definition of the human being as a political animal, as well as the Christian notion of natural moral law, at least for those aspects which might be differentiated from a gendered perspective.\n\nChappell introduces a distinction between passive and immediate moral perceptions vs active and step-by-step moral inferences, stating human actions are mainly performed on the basis of ethical intuitions which do not have a logical justification or did not have such a justification at the time they were enacted. Like sense perceptions, moral perceptions can be very vivid, or subjectively perceived as being certain, whilst moral inferences can be independent of their respective phenomenology or vividness.\nSome judgments might be considered to be moral perceptions because they appear to be \"obviously true\", self-evident and more certain than any rational argument with pros or cons. An example could be the following statement: \"at least in nearly all conceivable cases, it is seriously wrong to torture, steal, rape and murder.\" In such cases, rational arguments can appear to be unnecessary.\n\nIn a 2005 paper on the Theaetetus, Chappell discusses the definition of episteme in five Platonic dialogues, arguing that Plato's work has positively identified human knowledge with judgement (in Greek: doxa) supported by a rational argument for justification (logos). As suggested above, moral perceptions may not always need a rational argument to be justified.\n\nPersonal life\nChappell is transgender, and transitioned from male to female in 2014. She married in 1988, and has four children.\n\nWorks\n Moral perception, in Philosophy, 83 (4):421-437 (2008)\n Ethics Beyond Moral Theory, in Philosophical Investigations, 32 (3):206-243 (2009)\n Varieties of Knowledge in Plato and Aristotle, in  Topoi, 31: 175\u2013190(2012)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n\nAcademics of the Open University\nBritish philosophers\nBritish scholars of ancient Greek philosophy\nLGBT Anglicans\nLiving people\nTransgender academics\nTransgender scientists\nLGBT philosophers\nFellows of Merton College, Oxford\nAcademics of the University of East Anglia\nAcademics of the University of Manchester\nAcademics of the University of Dundee\n1964 births"}

{"eng_Latn":"The Halls of the Dwarven Kings is an adventure published by Integrated Games in 1984 for any role-playing game system.\n\nPlot summary\nThe Halls of the Dwarven Kings is an adventure set in the ruins of a vast dwarven city in which the player characters must find and retrieve the crown of an ancient dwarven king. It is designed to be used with any role-playing system; suggestions for converting statistics to systems similar to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons and RuneQuest are included.\n\nPublication history\nIntegrated Games planned a five-part fantasy role-playing adventure series called The Complete Dungeon Master Series. Between 1984 and 1987, Simon Forrest and Basil Barrett wrote four adventures, the first in 1984 being The Halls of the Dwarven Kings, a boxed set containing a 24-page book, an 8-page pamphlet, a 12-page illustration booklet, a cardstock screen, 12 colour cardstock floor plans, and 4 pages of play aids. Artwork was by Judith Hickling, Jes Goodwin, Jon Baker, Paul Ward, Toby Hardwick, and Selina Goodman.\n\nThe sequels that followed were The Lost Shrine of Kasar-Khan, The Watchers of the Sacred Flame, and The Feathered Priests. Integrated Games went out of business before a planned fifth adventure, Deep Water, Shallow Graves, was published. \n\nIn 1992, Flame Publications, an imprint of Games Workshop, bought the rights to The Complete Dungeon Master Series, and Simon Forrest, Brad Freeman and Graeme Davis revised all four adventures to conform to the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay rules, releasing them as the Doomstone Campaign Book Series. The first adventure in the series, The Halls of the Dwarven Kings, was retitled Fire in the Mountains.\n\nReception\nIn the April 1985 edition of Imagine (Issue 25), Paul Cockburn was impressed by the sheer amount of game material in the box, saying, \"no purchaser is likely to be disappointed. This is a lavishly-equipped DM aid.\" However, Cockburn was disappointed with the adventure, believing that players were encouraged to fight first rather than role-play. He pointed out that \"there is an excellent plot going on in the background, which the players can only truly understand through interaction with the NPCs \u2014 don't let the fighting start from the first room.\" He concluded, \"This is a good package. If it is not a great scenario, it certainly isn't one of the worst that I've ever run, and with some creative alterations, can be very good.\"    \n\nIn the June 1985 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #66), B.Y. Rowe called this adventure \"a new concept in gaming: everything for the harassed DM is done, all cross-referenced, reviewed, illustrated and explained.\" However, Rowe found the 12 pages of illustrations were \"not up to normal artwork status.\" Rowe praised the gamemaster's screen for having an entire keyed floorplan, and said \"the real bonuses are the cut-out maps, scrolls and artifacts.\"  Rowe concluded by giving the adventure an above average rating of 8 out of 10, saying, \"Halls of the Dwarven Kings is perfect as an illustration of how to set up an adventure; the DM need only read the background and then the characters can begin. This is the first of a new series and promises to be a worthwhile addition to any DM's armoury of adventures.\"\n\nIn the July 1988 edition of Dragon (Issue #135), Ken Rolston called the player handouts \"remarkable game aids and props\", and noted with approval that \"a particularly fine touch is that not all of these handouts are really significant.\" He also admired the floor plans, calling them \"well-designed\" and \"clearly rendered, not cluttered with illustration-style detail.\" He also thought the gamemaster screen was \"the most useful, detailed and well-designed DM screen I've ever used.\" Rolston did note that the dungeon was very complex; while he admitted that the result was \"pretty spectatcular\", he warned that \"studying and understanding the Dwarven Halls is no simple matter.\" He concluded with a strong recommendation for this and the other three adventures in the Complete Dungeon Master Series, saying, \"On presentation alone, it qualifies for the FRPG Supplement Hall of Fame. Experienced gamers should love it. Rookies may love it, too, but may find it too complex and sophisticated. Above all, Halls of the Dwarven Kings is unique for the amount of detail and variety of play aids lavished on a single scenario setting.\"\n\nReviews\nJeux & Strat\u00e9gie #32\n\nReferences\n\nFantasy role-playing game adventures\nRole-playing game supplements introduced in 1984"}

Along with the Synagogue of Tomar, it is one of two existing pre-expulsion synagogues in the country. Built in the late 14th century, it now houses a museum dedicated to Castelo de Vide's historical Jewish community.\n\nHistory\nThe Synagogue of Castelo de Vide was built sometime in the late 14th century. Written documents attest to the existence of Castelo de Vide's Jewish community and Jewish quarter throughout the 14th and 15th centuries. Though King Manuel I of Portugal ordered the forced conversion or expulsion of Portuguese Jews in 1496, Marranos continued using the synagogue as a religious sanctuary and school until the mid 16th century.\n\nOver the succeeding centuries the synagogue had various uses, including an 18th-century alteration into a private home. The building was restored and its tabernacle rediscovered in 1972. Today it houses a small museum dedicated to Castelo de Vide's historical Jewish community. The structure is listed as a Building of Public Interest (Im\u00f3vel de Interesse P\u00fablico) by the Portuguese government.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Synagogue of Castelo de Vide is one of two existing preserved medieval synagogues in Portugal. The other is the Synagogue of Tomar. Four pre-expulsion synagogue buildings exist in neighboring Spain: H\u00edjar Synagogue, the Synagogue of Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca and Synagogue of El Tr\u00e1nsito in Toledo, and C\u00f3rdoba Synagogue. All other existing Portuguese synagogues were built after the Portuguese Inquisition ended in 1821.\n\nThe synagogue is a small two-story building originally constructed in the late 14th century and altered over time. It is oriented east\u2013west. Ogival stone arches frame all of the building's doors. A mezuzah containing part of the Shema Yisrael prayer is placed over one of the ground floor doors.\n\nInside the building exists a 15th-century carved stone Torah ark or tabernacle (referred to as a hekhal by Sephardic communities) which was rediscovered in 1972 during repairs to the exterior walls.

Cortvriend attended Miami-Dade Community College. She is an owner of a marine plumbing firm she founded in 1989. Before 1989, she worked as a yacht captain. Cortvriend holds a private pilot's license and a USCG Captain's license. She was a member of the Portsmouth School Committee for a total of nine years first from 2004 to 2008 and later from 2012 to 2018. Four of those years she served as the chairperson of the school committee. She has served on numerous boards and committees in the area including, the Newport Chamber of Commerce, the Portsmouth Water and Fire District Advisory Board, the Portsmouth Economic Development Committee, and the Portsmouth Charter Review Committee.\n\nRhode Island House of Representatives\nCortvriend was first elected to the House for the 72nd district in 2018, defeating Republican incumbent Kenneth J. Mendonca. District 72 is made up of parts of Portsmouth, Rhode Island and Middletown, Rhode Island on Aquidneck Island in Newport County.\n\nElections\n2018\nCortvriend announced that she was running after learning that Linda Finn, the Democratic representative who had previously been defeated by Mendoca, said she was not running. She ran as a small business owner who opposed Mendoca's bill that would allow businesses to pay workers under the age of 20 less than minimum wage. She also campaigned in favor of environmental protections. Cortvriend ran unopposed in the democratic primary and then later defeated Mendonca in the general election 54.6% to 45.3%.\n2020\nCortvriend announced that she was running for reelection. She campaigned on sponsoring the Nathan Bruno and Jason Flatt Act, bringing climate literacy to K-12 schools, and helping constituents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Republican Kenneth Mendoca also announced that he was running for his old seat.

Cortvriend won the primary contest against Christopher T. Semonelli with 80.7% of the vote and ended up defeating Mendoca again in the general election 57.5% to 42.3%.\n\nTenure\nIn 2020 RI Rank named Cortvriend the number one ranked representative in the House.

She is a member of the reform caucus which is a group of members who seek the rules of the House to be more transparent, open, and more democratic.\nEnvironment and climate\nCortvriend was one of the founders of the Aquidneck Island Climate Caucus which is a group of legislators and their constituents who want to give voice to the importance of mitigating and adapting to the changing climate. The caucus will be used as a vehicle for legislators to engage with their communities about environmental bills and issues coming before them.\nAmericans with Disabilities\nCortvriend was the lead sponsor in the House Preservation Of Families With Disabled Parent Act which was signed into law by Governor Dan McKee. The law makes it so that a parent's disability cannot be the sole basis to deny or restrict their rights in regards a child's welfare, foster care, family law, guardianship or adoption.\nPublic health\nCortvriend sponsored the Nathan Bruno and Jason Flatt Act which would require two hours of suicide prevention training for all licensed educators in the state.

{"eng_Latn":"Friedrich Uhlhorn (17 June 1894 \u2013 24 July 1978) was an honorary professor at the Philipps-Universit\u00e4t Marburg, whose scientific focus was on the history of the State of Hesse and was also known for his work outside Hesse. His special scientific interest was mainly focused on the problems of historical cartography. In collaboration with Edmund Ernst Stengel, he published the Geschichtlichen Atlas von Hessen, which is considered his major work. He also wrote the article Die deutschen Territorien. A: The West, which deals with the West German regional history. Likewise he was responsible as editor for the  by Bruno Gebhardt.\n\nLife\n\nYouth \nBorn in Lauenf\u00f6rde, Uhlhorn came from a family of theologians in southern Lower Saxony. He was born as son of the pastor Friedrich Uhlhorn and his wife Elisabeth n\u00e9e M\u00fcller. Uhlhorn's school education began in 1901, He acquired his Abitur on 24 February 1914 at the humanistic grammar school in Hameln.\n\nAcademic career \nFrom August 1914 to 1918 Uhlhorn did his military service in the First World War. His studies officially began in 1914, after the First World War he continued them from 1919 to 1923. He studied history, German and Latin in Marburg and G\u00f6ttingen and finished his studies with the Staatsexamen in 1923. During his studies he became a member of the .\nHe also began training as an archivist in Berlin-Dahlem. He soon returned to Marburg for good, however, to prepare his doctorate under Edmund E. Stengel. The title of this auxiliary-scientific work, which was published in 1924, is Die Gro\u00dfbuchstaben der sogenannten gotischen Schrift mit besonderer Ber\u00fccksichtigung der Hildesheimer Stadtschreiber (The Capital Letters of the so-called Gothic Script with Special Consideration of the Hildesheim Town Writers). From 1923 to 1946, Uhlhorn worked as archivist of the House of the Princes and counts of Solms, with the task to write a history of the House.\n\nDuring this period he was a lecturer from 1936, and from 1940 honorary professor at the Philipps-Universit\u00e4t Marburg for Hessian local history.\n\nHessian Regional Studies \nHis connection to his doctoral supervisor Edmund E. Stengel and the \"Atlaswerkstatt\", the later  with its seat in the Kugelhaus in Marburg, also continued during his work as archivist. From 1935, Uhlhorn was responsible for Edmund Stengel's new project, and he was also in charge of the preparation of the Geschichtliche Hand- und Volksatlas von Hessen. This atlas was financed with funds from the Kassel district government and was to be produced alongside the primary academic atlas Geschichtlicher Atlas f\u00fcr Hessen und Nassau. Stengel named the Hessian people and the Hessian youth as a target group in order to bring the Hessian landscape closer to them again. By the beginning of the Second World War, however, it was no more than a draft.\n\nAfter the Second World War, in which he participated just as in the First World War, he became curator at the Hessian State Office for Historical Regional Studies in 1947. After the end of the war, Uhlhorn pursued the goal of providing a first delivery of atlas maps for the entire area. Thus he prepared political maps for the years 1550, 1648 and 1789, which were never published. The project was later discontinued despite Uhlhorn's intensive efforts. Uhlhorn also started work on the Geschichtlichen Handatlas during this period. Following on from the work before the outbreak of war, this atlas was intended to serve schools, universities and all those interested in history as a reference and illustrative work. Uhlhorn worked intensively on this project, various government agencies were interested in the creation of this map series, which ultimately convinced Stengel, who was not too keen, of the necessity of this project and put the completion of the \"gro\u00dfen Atlas\" first.\n\nThis project was not completed in addition to the many other projects. However, a number of smaller scientific atlases were published, one of the first in Germany being the Geschichtlicher Atlas von Hessen.\nFrom the winter semester of 1964 he was granted a leave of absence for health reasons. Even after his retirement, Uhlhorn continued to work on this atlas and its design and layout, From 1960 to 1978, twelve volumes were published, comprising a total of 79 maps and 53 sheets. The volume with text and explanations published by Fred Schwind in 1984 concluded the atlas.\n\nUhlhorn died in Marburg on July 24, 1978 at the age of 84 and was buried at the cemetery at Rotenberg in Marburg. The city of Marburg declared his grave a municipal grave of honour.\n\nAchievements \nUhlhorn's achievements in the scientific field of Hesse's state history are particularly noteworthy. He was well known beyond the borders of Hesse, for example, as he dealt with the historical foundations of the present-day state of Hesse at an early stage. His collaboration on the Geschichtlichen Atlas von Hessen, which is his main work, his function as chairman of the Marburg Historical Society, but not least his numerous publications on Hessian state history topics clearly show his deep connection to Hessian history and his interest in research until his death in 1978. In his obituary of him, Fred Schwind emphasizes that during his time as archivist of the Princely House of Solms, he sought to convey to his students the \"insight into the intimate relationship between the landscape and the historically active man [...] in his lectures and especially on excursions.\" From 1951 on, he was responsible as editor for the first 14 volumes of the Hessian Hessischen Jahrbuchs f\u00fcr Landesgeschichte and is thus also significantly involved in its presentation and the high standing it occupies among the journals of the State history.\n\nWritings \n Die Gro\u00dfbuchstaben der sogenannten gotischen Schrift mit besonderer Ber\u00fccksichtigung der Hildesheimer Stadtschreiber.

{"eng_Latn":"Tropical Storm Fay was the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in the U.S state of New Jersey since Hurricane Irene in 2011. The sixth named storm of the very active 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay was the earliest sixth named storm on record in the basin when it formed on July\u00a09. Fay originated from a surface low that formed over the Northern Gulf of Mexico on July 3 and slowly drifted eastward, before crossing over the Florida Panhandle. The system subsequently drifted across the Southeastern United States as a well-defined low pressure system, before emerging off the coast of North Carolina on July 8. From there, the storm utilized favorable conditions for development, or tropical cyclogenesis, and coalesced into a tropical storm on July\u00a09. The storm intensified, reaching its peak intensity on July 10, with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of  and a minimum central pressure of . While moving northward, Fay made landfall on New Jersey later that day. After making landfall, the storm quickly lost most of its organization and rapidly transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone over New York on July\u00a011, before being absorbed by a larger extratropical low over Quebec on July 12.\n\nFay's precursor disturbance was responsible for extensive rainfall and flash flooding in the Southeastern United States, especially within Georgia and South Carolina. After its landfall, Tropical Storm Fay brought high winds and stormy weather to much of the Mid-Atlantic states and the Northeastern United States, with the heaviest rains occurring west of Long Island. Six people were killed by rip currents and flooding related to the storm. Many interstates and other principal highways throughout the Philadelphia and New York City metropolitan areas were flooded and were left impassable, leading to widespread road closures and disruption to commuters. Uprooted trees and damaged power lines from windy conditions caused thousands of power outages in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Total economic losses from Fay in the United States exceeded US$220 million.\n\nMeteorological history\n\nFay can first be traced back to a decaying trough of frontal origin, which was drifting across the southeastern United States on July 1\u20132. A portion of the trough formed into a low pressure system off the coast of Georgia, which would later become Tropical Storm Edouard, and the remaining section of the trough persisted over the northern Gulf of Mexico and proceeded to spawn an elongated region of low atmospheric pressure. By July\u00a04, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned the possibility of eventual tropical cyclogenesis from this trough in the northern Gulf of Mexico, which at that time consisted of disorganized convection, or thunderstorms. A smaller-scale low pressure center formed within the disturbance, but before the feature could further consolidate, it moved inland near Panama City, Florida around 06:00 UTC on July 6. Surface and Doppler weather radar observations confirmed the feature had a small 90 nmi radius of 1-minute sustained winds up to , characteristic of a tropical cyclone, but was accompanied by a large, disorganized area of thunderstorms and thus, didn't meet the NHC's criteria to be deemed a tropical cyclone. While inland, the NHC assessed a 50% probability that the weather system would become a tropical or subtropical cyclone, which the agency soon raised to a 70% probability. The low moved through Georgia and proceeded to turned eastward under the influence of the southern edge of the mid-latitude westerly winds, crossing over southern South Carolina, before emerging into the Western Atlantic on July 8. On July 9, the thunderstorm activity of the low increased as it moved northeastward, parallel to the coast of North Carolina even as the system experienced a sudden slowing in its forward motion.\n\nLate on July\u00a09, United States Air Force hurricane hunters flew into the system and detected a low-level circulation center near the edge of its thunderstorms, which indicated a reformation of the original low-level circulation center, with the development of strong convection just east of Cape Hatteras. Based on the organization of the system, and observations of  sustained winds, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Fay at 21:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a09. The storm was located over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream and in an area of light to moderate wind shear; these environmental factors favored intensification of the tropical cyclone. The elongated circulation of the developing storm was steered generally northward by a ridge over the western Atlantic Ocean and by an approaching trough from the south. On July 10, Fay strengthened throughout the day, reaching its peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds of  and a minimum central pressure of , despite some southwesterly wind shear. This wind shear caused the storm to entrain dry air, which gave it a non-classical tropical cyclone structure. At that time, Fay had a small circulation center exposed just east of the Delmarva peninsula, which was rotating around a larger circulation. Around 20:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a010, Fay made landfall just north-northeast of Atlantic City, New Jersey with maximum sustained winds of . By that time, the system was already losing some of its tropical characteristics, with rapidly decreasing amounts of thunderstorms near the center and the deepest convection displaced well to the east and southeast of the center. Fay continued weakening as it moved northward through New Jersey, and weakened into a tropical depression as it crossed into southeastern New York. Early on July 11, the system transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone as the center became devoid of deep convection. Afterward, Fay's remnants were drawn into the circulation of an approaching extratropical storm, before being fully absorbed into the approaching system over Quebec on July 12.\n\nPreparations\n\nUpon issuing its first advisory on Fay, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a tropical storm warning from Cape May, New Jersey to Watch Hill, Rhode Island, including Long Island and Block Island. On July\u00a010, the NHC extended the warning southward to Fenwick Island, Delaware, including the Delaware Bay. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for much of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, all of New Jersey, and New York City. The entirety of Long Island was also placed under a flash flood warning.\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump's rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire was delayed. Due to concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rally was supposed to be held outdoors. However, forecasters expected heavy rainfall and gusty winds from Fay or its remnants, which led the Trump campaign to postpone the rally, due to safety precautions.\n\nLifeguards restricted swimming in three Delaware beaches due to the threat for rip currents. Jersey Shore locals were advised to avoid the coast, due to the threat of high waves, while community leaders began to take precautions to diminish flooding threats, such as lowering water levels in nearby lakes. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo released a statement on July 9, urging New York State residents to stay alert and cautious, due to the impending severe weather conditions, highlighting a significant chance of flash flooding. Residents of New York City were advised by New York City Emergency Management to take emergency precautions and to prepare for power outages and locally strong wind gusts.\n\nImpact\n\nSoutheastern United States \nThe precursor disturbance to Fay moved into the Florida Panhandle and crossed over into Georgia on July 6, delivering heavy rainfall throughout the state and causing widespread flash flooding as far as the Savannah River valley. Augusta, Georgia recorded its wettest day in July on record, with  of rain falling in 24 hours, breaking the record of  that had stood since 1887.  of rain fell in 48 hours in Loco. US$4,000 worth of property damage occurred in Ringgold, when a severe thunderstorm generated by the disturbance caused  winds in the city, causing trees to become uprooted or topple over onto homes. Many roads in South Carolina were deemed inaccessible and became flooded, while one road became completely washed out. Hunting Island State Park in South Carolina recorded at least  of rain due to the disturbance and had to be closed; over 100 sea turtle nests were also destroyed within the park boundaries. Beachgoers on the North Carolina coast observed two waterspouts on July 6, with one of them moving ashore and becoming an EF0 tornado, which lifted an umbrella, although it is not clear as to whether or not this was actually caused by Fay or another approaching extratropical storm from the west.\n\nNortheastern United States \nFay's impacts were felt across a majority of the Northeastern U.S., with widespread rain, flash flooding, and minor wind damage occurring as a result of the storm. Losses from Fay in this region were estimated to be at least US$350 million.\n\nDelaware and Pennsylvania \nWhile Fay was near peak intensity, its rainbands produced gale-force winds along the Delaware coast, with sustained winds of  and gusts as high as  recorded near Long Neck. Several other Mesonet and DelDOT sites measured tropical storm-force wind gusts along the coastline as well. The storm uprooted trees and knocked down power lines in Long Neck and Nassau. Rainfall in the state reached  near Lewes. Heavy rainfall caused flooding in Sussex County, reaching depths of  in Bethany Beach. Floodwaters covered portions of DE 1, including the area just south of the Indian River Inlet Bridge. The intersection of DE 1 and DE 54 in Fenwick Island was flooded, where a vehicle knocked down a pedestrian signal pole at the intersection. There was also minor beach erosion along several Delaware beaches. Tidal flooding also occurred farther north in the state along the Christina River in New Castle County. Fay also caused flash flooding in neighboring Pennsylvania, with a rainfall total of  recorded in Wynnewood. At least six drivers required rescue when their vehicles were flooded. Pennypack Creek exceeded its flood stage of , sending floodwaters flowing near Philadelphia. The storm also knocked down trees and power lines across eastern Pennsylvania.\n\nNew Jersey and New York State \n\nIn neighboring New Jersey, Fay also dropped heavy rainfall, totaling  near Wildwood Crest. Various areas reported rainfall totals up to \u2013 despite initial forecasts only showing rainfall totals as high as . The storm caused flooding in several Jersey Shore towns, including Wildwood, North Wildwood, Sea Isle City, and Ocean City, with streets covered in water and some road closures occurring. Flooded roads included portions of the New Jersey Turnpike, Interstates\u00a0287 and 295, U.S. Routes\u00a09, 30, 202, 322; and several state and local roads. Sustained winds in New Jersey reached  near Strathmere, with gusts up to . The winds knocked down trees and power lines, causing some road closures. Tropical storm-force wind gusts up to  brought down trees across Monmouth County. Widespread roadway flooding in Stone Harbor, Avalon, Sea Isle City, and Rio Grande in Cape May County left many roads impassable and forced New Jersey Route 47 to be closed. Additionally, New Jersey Routes 10, 35, 45, 66, and 77 were flooded and closed. Police in Ocean City alerted drivers to avoid the southern portion of the city as roads quickly became impassable due to floodwaters. 10,000 people lost power in the state across 74 different cities. Feet of floodwaters covered roads in Ocean City, Margate City, and Gloucester City, and caused several people to need rescuing. A trained spotter reported floodwaters near Gloucester City Middle School as deep as . Social media reported that a railroad overpass in Hoboken was flooded; cars were left unable to move, with water up to the car doors. 18 residents in Newark, New Jersey had to be rescued from floodwaters by the Newark Fire Department, most of whom were stranded within their vehicles.\n\nAs Fay passed west of New York City, the storm caused heavy rainfall along its path. An Automated Surface Observation System (ASOS) in Central Park recorded a total of  of rain, while several Mesonet stations in the Boroughs of New York City recorded rainfall totals as high as  in Midtown Manhattan,  in Brooklyn,  on Staten Island,  in The Bronx, and 2.08 inches (52.8) in Queens. The storm reportedly flooded several New York City Subway stations as well.\n\nAn 18-year-old swimmer who rescued two of his friends from drowning eventually drowned in the ocean near Atlantic City. An unidentified teenager in Eastern New Jersey was pulled underwater in a strong rip current and their body was never recovered, presumably having drowned, according to a media report. A 77-year-old swimmer and a 17-year-old swimmer injured from rough surf conditions were also pulled from the ocean at Atlantic City and Raritan Bay, respectively, on July 11, and later died from their injuries. A 24-year-old man went missing while swimming and was presumed dead by authorities in Ocean City, New Jersey. On July 18, a fisherman off the Great Egg Harbor Inlet discovered the deceased body of the missing man.\n\nIn Long Beach, New York, a 19-year-old drowned off the coast, after being caught in rip currents from Fay. He was with five other swimmers, whom were rescued after also being caught in the rip currents.\n\nNew England \n\nIn Maine, the post-tropical remnants of Fay briefly spawned a waterspout over Baker Lake, which became an EF0 tornado once it moved ashore between Hiram and Naples on July 11, with minor damage to some trees and homes. Despite the post-tropical cyclone passing over the state, rainfall totals did not exceed  and there were no other reports of damage.\n\nIn Vermont, post-tropical Fay brought rain showers across the state but there was no reports of damage. Connecticut was affected by rain showers due to the cyclone but had escaped most of the severe impacts. A 1-minute sustained wind of  and a wind gust of  was recorded near Norwalk. The city of Bridgeport experienced their second wettest July day on record with  of rain. A 64-year-old Massachusetts man was also identified as a victim of drowning off a Rhode Island beach on July 12, although it is unclear whether Fay was responsible for the fatality.\n\nSee also \n\n Tropical cyclones in 2020\n Other storms of the same name\n List of Delaware hurricanes\n List of Maryland hurricanes (1950\u2013present)\n List of New Jersey hurricanes\n List of Pennsylvania hurricanes\n List of New York hurricanes\n List of New England hurricanes\n Tropical Storm Danielle (1992) \u2013 struck the same area at a similar intensity with similar effects.\n Hurricane Irene (2011) \u2013 caused significant damage to New Jersey and surrounding areas as a much larger tropical storm.\n Hurricane Sandy (2012) \u2013 caused catastrophic damage in the same regions as a hurricane-force post-tropical cyclone.\n Hurricane Isaias (2020) \u2013 affected the northeast just a few weeks later, causing severe damage.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n NHC advisory archive for Tropical Storm Fay\n\nFay (2020)\nFay\nTropical cyclones in 2020\nHurricanes in New Jersey\nHurricanes in Delaware\nHurricanes in New York (state)"}

{"eng_Latn":"Roger Pryor Dodge (21 January 1898 \u2014 2 June 1974) was an American ballet, vaudeville, and jazz dancer, as well as a choreographer and pioneering jazz critic. He formed the first extensive collection of photographic portraits of Vaslav Nijinsky.\n\nSelf-taught, his original thinking contributed to the understanding of the relationship of jazz to classical music and to dance. He endeavored to break down barriers between jazz and other 'serious' art forms and build the respect it deserved.\n\nDodge\u2019s taste in jazz was formed in 1924, initially from listening to recordings of Fletcher Henderson and others, then refined when Miguel Covarrubias, newly arrived from Mexico and already ensconced in the Harlem Renaissance, introduced Dodge to recordings of Bessie Smith.\n\nJazz inspired Dodge to crystalize a unique style of white American dance, whereupon he choreographed dances to Duke Ellington's recordings with James \"Bubber\" Miley among others. For years, he performed these pieces in multiple locations in New York, brought a dance trio to perform in Paris, and filmed several of these numbers years later, c1937. His performance career ended in 1942 due to a back injury.\n\nEarly life\n\nDodge was born in Paris during one of the family\u2019s extended sojourns. His father, American muralist William de Leftwich Dodge, a first place laureate of the Ecole des Beaux Arts, would visit to paint and exhibit at the Salon, often residing in Giverny. Upon their return, Dodge spent his childhood in Setauket, near Stony Brook on Long Island. He attended the Phillips Brooks School in Philadelphia, followed by The Pennington School in New Jersey, but quit before graduating. Later the family moved to Greenwich Village.\n\nDance\n\nEducation\n\nIn 1916, Dodge\u2019s Ritz-Carlton ballroom social dance partner introduced him to ballet\u2014Les Ballets Russes starring Vaslav Nijinsky. This pivotal experience inspired Dodge to study classical ballet, attend performances of and study with Fokine and Fokina in 1919-1920, experience the Isadora Duncan Dancers (\u201cIsadorables\u201d), and shortly thereafter, to leave for Paris to continue his ballet studies with Nikolai Legat, one of Nijinsky's teachers, Lyubov Yegorova, who had partnered with Nijinsky, and L\u00e9o Staats, the ma\u00eetre de ballet at the Paris Opera.\n\nUpon his return to New York in 1921, Dodge continued studying with Michel Fokine (1922). His desire to explore dance expression beyond ballet inspired him in 1922 to study eurhythmics at the Dalcroze School, Isadora Duncan technique with Elise Dufour, and modern dance with Michio It\u014d.\n\nNijinsky photographs\n\nNijinsky\u2019s career ended in 1917. As he had never been filmed, Dodge realized that the only available means to experience Nijinsky\u2019s greatness would be through photography. While in Paris taking ballet lessons and with the foresight to preserve a photographic record, Dodge proceeded to order prints from the photographers who had taken studio portraits of Nijinsky in his various roles. At times skipping meals to afford them, he assembled the most comprehensive collection of photographic images of Vaslav Nijinsky. By 1937 memory of Nijinsky had faded, prompting Dodge to help revive interest by donating his collection to the Dance Collection of the New York Public Library.\n\nPractically every book on Nijinsky has borrowed from the Dodge collection, beginning in 1934 with Nijinsky by his wife Romola. After Dodge's numerous failed attempts to publish a book of his entire collection, in 1975 Lincoln Kirstein produced Nijinsky Dancing, drawing from half of Dodge\u2019s collection.\n\nUnder Acknowledgements, Lincoln Kirstein writes:\n\nKirstein comments on viewing Dodge's performance to Ellington's \"Black and Tan Fantasy\" in 1935:\n\nDance partners (selection)\nDodge created his earliest choreography in 1922 for all-male ensembles.\n\nIn 1930, Dodge formed a male trio with Jack Nile, and Arthur Mahoney who he had met during their engagements at the Metropolitan Opera House.\n\nThe same year, Dodge met Mura Dehn, a recent Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9, when they each presented their jazz dance numbers in the Billy Rose Show \u201cSweet and Low.\u201d As Dehn states, their pieces were \u201cA daring jump into the Modern-Grotesque for the producer: a first such experiment in a commercial musical.\u201d\n\nThey formed a professional dance relationship and appeared in each other\u2019s choreography. Dodge filmed their dances c1937. They frequented the Harlem and Savoy Ballrooms, \u201cand always had tumultuous discussions about art, dance, theatre, comedy. He rarely accepted other people\u2019s understanding of his theories, even if they repeated them \u2018verbatim\u2019.

In his first article, \u201cNegro Jazz,\u201d a response to reviews at the time, Dodge argued that \"the word 'jazz' is being used too loosely and too indiscriminately by persons who have little perception of the true nature of the embryonic form now developing amongst us,\" and that \u201cGershwin selected that stalest of decadent forms the rhapsody; an episodic form that allows the furthest possible departure from the logical carrying to completion to a single musical idea, and hence, probably the form more remote from the genuine jazz ideal than any other.\u201d\n \nIn response to the great importance accorded written jazz, either composed or arranged, in 1934 Dodge offered an appreciation of the improvised solo in \"Harpsichords and Jazz Trumpets.\" He maintained that \u201cimprovisation is absolutely imperative to the development of an art form such as music and dancing,\u201d and referring to contemporary evidence from 1639 for support, he quoted Andr\u00e9 Maugars\u2019 experience in Rome:\n\nAndr\u00e9 Maugars:\n\nTo illustrate the potential for the future of jazz, Dodge asserted that \u201cjazz has reached the highest development of any folk music since the early Christian hymns and dances grew into the most developed contrapuntal music known to history.\u201d Considering current taste, he added, \u201cWhen I hear an early record of Bessie Smith and then listen to a Cab Calloway and see how much more the Negro now enjoys the latter, I realize that the blues have been superseded and white decadence has once more ironed out and sweetened a vital art.\u201d\n\nClassical music\nIn response to the vital swing Dodge felt missing in interpretations of Baroque music during its early-to-mid 20th century revival, and in an effort to identify a reliable common style element applicable to various period genres, in 1955 he\npublished \u201cThe Importance of Dance Style in the Presentation of Early Western Instrumental Music.\u201d (view article at External links)\n\nArticles on jazz (selection)\n1929 Negro Jazz.

After rehearsals recorded on his Wollensak, Dodge would return disappointed, for the musicians tended to improvise in a contemporary rather than period style. Fundamental aspects of playing style were a concern Dodge also applied to early classical music performance.\n\nLast years\nAt the age of 75, thirty years after his last performance, Dodge intended to film himself in five Baroque solo court dances. His costume was based on a print of Faune in Le Triomphe de Bacchus, together with a home-made white papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask. Three dances were to be accompanied by excerpts from Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, Bach's Wedding Cantata and a Handel Organ Sonata. The other two were a sarabande by Rameau and a dance by C. P. E. Bach. He did not live to see the project completed.\n\nHe did perform these dances at home for Mura Dehn, and in addition, a new version of an early jazz dance composition. Dehn wrote that these pieces were a summation of his knowledge of and reflections on dance, performed with the style of an average middle-aged gentleman with artistry and taste. She could envision that George Washington would have danced in that manner. However his jazz piece was wild with abandon.\n\nFurther reading\nIn an effort to republish Dodge\u2019s jazz articles, Albert Murray introduced Oxford University Press to Dodge\u2019s oeuvre, resulting in Hot Jazz and Jazz Dance: Collected Writings, 1929-1964.

{"eng_Latn":"The Monsanto family is a historical Sephardic Jewish merchant and banking business who played a significant role in founding the Jewish community in Colonial Louisiana (then transferring between French and Spanish rule) in the 18th century. They had originated in the Iberian Peninsula but moved to Amsterdam and spread out through the Dutch Empire and to the Americas at Cura\u00e7ao. The family arrived in Louisiana in the 1760s, and one of their members, Isaac Monsanto, was one of the wealthiest merchants in New Orleans. The family engaged in the Atlantic slave trade and owned African slaves at their plantations at Natchez, Mississippi (this was later known as Glenfield Plantation) and Trianon, New Orleans. Not including their former estate in New Orleans, by the 1780s, the Monsantos kept 51 slaves for their personal use and sold other enslaved African people to Louisiana plantations.\n\nHistory\nThe Monsanto family were Sephardic Jews, who derive their name from Monsanto (meaning \"Holy Mountain\"), a village in Portugal.  They had lived for a time as Marranos; people who outwardly conformed to the Catholic Church but continued to practice Judaism in private. They were active in trade in Andalusia, Spain (they were located at Sevilla and M\u00e1laga) for a time during the 17th century, before moving on to Amsterdam, in the United Provinces of the Netherlands during the lifetime of Isaac Rodriguez Monsanto (1645\u20141695). It is in the Netherlands that the Monsanto brothers who came to the Americas were born. They first moved out across the Atlantic Sea to Cura\u00e7ao in the Caribbean, which was then part of the Netherlands Antilles.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Seven Years' War, with both realms under the House of Bourbon, the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762) stipulated that French Louisiana, then part of New France, be transferred to New Spain as Spanish Louisiana. The transfer was actually gradual and in a state of flux during the time that the Monsanto family arrived. Previously, Jews were technically barred from living in French America from 1685 onwards under the terms of the Code Noir, though this was not enforced as strictly during the political flux of the mid-1700s and so the Monsanto family were able to operate. This and the end of the Seven Years' War, which meant the opportunity for trade with Europe, attracted Jews to New Orleans who had been involved in the slave trade in the Caribbean (ie - Cura\u00e7ao, Jamaica and Saint-Domingue) and also the inter-American slave trade between the Caribbean and territories bordering the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIndeed, it was Isaac Monsanto (died 1778) who was the first member of the family to arrive in New Orleans from Dutch Cura\u00e7ao, with his fellow Sephardi trade partners; Isaac Henriques Fastio and Manuel de Britto. He developed a strong working relationship with Louis Billouart, Chevalier de Kerl\u00e9rec, the French Governor, which opened him up to trade with Abraham Gradis, a prominent Jewish merchant in Bordeaux.  These Sephardi merchants, along with David Mendes France, Samuel Israel, Joseph Palacios and Alexander Solomons becoming pioneers in founding the Louisiana Jewish community in the 1760s. Aside from Isaac Monsanto, his siblings, who lived with him at first in New Orleans included the brothers Manuel, Benjamin and Jacob Monsanto, as well as the sisters Ang\u00e9lica, Eleanora and Gracia Monsanto. They lived together for a while at Chartes Street in the French Quarter. Isaac Monsanto founded the fortunes of the family and in 1767 purchased a slave plantation at Trianon beyond the city limits of New Orleans and had become one of the richest merchants in the city by 1769. He was also a banker and Superior Court translator; despite a Spanish restrictions on certain forms of trade, Isaac Monsanto funded a British expedition up the Mississippi River to the Illinois territory they had won in the French and Indian War. This illegal trade angered the local Catholic Criollo population who erupted in protests and consequently, the Spanish Governor, Alejandro O'Reilly, expelled the Monsantos and other Jews from New Orleans for their illegal trading in 1769 (though they were not completely pushed out of Louisiana). They then moved out to Manchac near Lake Pontchartrain (then part of British North America), where they were trade partners of John Fitzpatrick and Point Coupee, still part of Spanish Louisiana. Isaac Monsanto would dip in and out of New Orleans itself with little suppression from the Spanish authorities, now that the Sephardim's economic influence had been reduced. The governor Luis de Unzaga Am\u00e9zaga 'le Conciliateur', characterized by his tolerance and also with Sephardic origins, signed the visas to the merchant Isaac Monsanto and his son Jacob Monsanto, who had businesses between Manchac, Mobile and Pensacola and since 1774 in New Orleans too again.\n\nThe Monsanto sisters settled in Pensacola in British Florida and married in quick succession; Pierre Andr\u00e9 Tessier de Villauchamps (Eleanora), Thomas Topham (Gracia) and George Urquhart (Ang\u00e9lica). Urquhart, a Lowland Scot, was involved in local politics in West Florida. During the American Revolution, Manchac was captured by the Spanish ending Monsanto influence there. After the death of her husband in 1779, Ang\u00e9lica Monsanto married another Lowland Scot, Dr. Robert Dow and returned to New Orleans. After the death of Isaac, the brothers Manuel, Benjamin and Jacob Monsanto continued on their merchant activities. As well as the earlier slave plantation at Trianon, Benjamin Monsanto and his wife Clara owned a 500-acre slave plantation on St Catherine's Creek near Natchez, Mississippi from 1787 onwards (this was later known as Glenfield Plantation). During this time the Monsantos kept 51 Africans as their slaves for personal use (Benjamin owned 17, Ang\u00e9lica owned 8, Eleanora owned 4 and Manuel owned 12) and sold other enslaved Black people to slave plantations owners in Louisiana. One of the biggest slave deals Benjamin Monsanto engaged in occurred in 1785, when he traded thirteen \"Negroes\" for three thousand pounds of indigo. As well as slaves and indigo, they also traded in liquor, clothes, silverware, lumber, fabric, tea, tobacco, soap, animals furs and horses. As a multilingual and cosmopolitan family who could speak French, Spanish and English, the Monsantos were effective operators among the various different European settlers in the area and even after their \"official\" expulsion from New Orleans still had strong contacts with the local establishment. Manuel and Jacob Monsanto were back living at Toulouse Street in New Orleans by the mid-1780s. Benjamin Monsanto (died 10 October 1794) was appointed by Manuel Gayoso de Lemos, the Governor of Spanish Louisiana, to teams of citizens who dealt with inventories and appraisals of the slave plantation estates of deceased neighbours. Benjamin Monsanto had a brother, Manuel Jacob Monsanto, who was also prominent in Louisiana, he was known for his involvement in the slave trade where he dealt in African slaves (he engaged in twelve such contracts between 1787 and 1789).\n\nA scion of the Monsanto family was Mauricio M\u00e9ndez Monsanto (1835\u20141891) who had business operations based out of St. Thomas in the Danish West Indies (this would later become part of the U. S. Virgin Islands in 1917). Monsanto's daughter Olga M\u00e9ndez Monsanto (1871\u20131938) was married to John Francis Queeny (1859\u20131933) of St. Louis, Missouri, who founded the Monsanto Chemical Company, naming it after his wife. Her grandfather, Manuel M\u00e9ndez Monsanto (died 1863), was a merchant and sugar financier with holdings on both St. Thomas and Vieques in Puerto Rico, who was ennobled by the Spanish for his role in Vieques' commercialisation.\n\nSee also\n Pushcarts and Plantations: Jewish Life in Louisiana\n History of the Jews in Cura\u00e7ao\n\nReferences\n\nFootnotes\n\nBibliography\n\nAmerican Jews\nSephardi families\nJewish families\nPeople of Louisiana (New France)\nPeople of Colonial Spanish Louisiana\nJews and Judaism in Louisiana\nJews and Judaism in New Orleans\nSpanish and Portuguese Jews"}

The river pours into the bottom of a bay () on the east bank of the Ottawa River, in Holden Lake, facing Grants Creek (Ontario) and Pichette Bay (Ontario).\n\nThe mouth of the Petite rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'Ours is located  downstream of the mouth of the rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'Ours and  upstream of the mouth of the Dumoine River.\n\nToponymy \n\nAnimals are used frequently in French Canadian toponymy. The bear is an animal respected for its character and its strength. Its meat is edible. Its bones (after having been cut or sharpened) can be used to make tools, such as scrapers, or weapons. Its skin can be used in particular for clothing, bags, blankets, carpets or shelter. The bear is the subject of several legends, generally of Aboriginal origin.\n\nThe toponym Petite rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'Ours is associated with the nearby watercourse (west side) which is designated rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'Ours.\n\nThe toponym Petite rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'Ours was formalized on 5 December 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nSee also \n\n List of rivers of Quebec\n\nNotes and references \n\nRivers of Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue"}

After she was ordered in October 2016 with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri, her coin ceremony was held in February 2019 and she was floated out in May 2020 from the shipyard in Sestri Ponente. She was delivered to Virgin in July 2021 as the fleet's second vessel and sailed her maiden voyage in March 2022 from Portsmouth. At  and measuring  long for a capacity of 2,770 passengers, she was built with similar proportions to older sister ship Scarlet Lady.\n\nConstruction and career\n\nPlanning and construction \nOn 4 December 2014, Virgin Group founder Richard Branson announced that Virgin Group was forming Virgin Cruises, together with the backing of Bain Capital, and revealed plans to build two new cruise ships. On 23 June 2015, Virgin Cruises announced that it signed a letter of intent with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri for three cruise ships that could each accommodate approximately 2,800 guests and 1,150 crew for seven-day Caribbean voyages. The three-ship order reportedly cost US$2.55 billion, with the second ship scheduled to begin operating in 2021. The order's contract for the ships was formally signed on 18 October 2016, the same day Virgin Cruises rebranded as Virgin Voyages. In joining her sister ship, initial details revealed she would measure ,  long, and  wide, with 1,400 passenger cabins to house up to approximately 2,700 passengers, accompanied by 1,150 crew members.\n\nOn 20 July 2018, Virgin inaugurated the construction for its second ship with the ship's steel-cutting ceremony at Fincantieri's shipyard in Sestri Ponente. The ship's coin ceremony was performed on 8 February 2019. On 19 November 2019, Virgin revealed the name of its second ship as Valiant Lady. During the COVID-19 pandemic, construction delays arose after Fincantieri's operations were suspended. Originally expected to be floated out in March 2020, Valiant Lady was floated out from her dry dock two months behind schedule, on 20 May 2020, and was moved to a new berth to complete her outfitting work. The ship was delivered on 1 July 2021.\n\nOperational career \nValiant Lady entered service on 18 March 2022, sailing a three night cruise from Portsmouth, England to Zeebrugge, Belgium. She continued sailing from Portsmouth with itineraries visiting Belgium, Spain, Portugal and the Canary Islands before repositioning to the Mediterranean in summer 2022. From May 2022, she sailed from Barcelona to destinations in Italy, Spain, Gibraltar and France. She then repositioned to Miami, Florida in October 2022 to operate cruises to the Caribbean over the winter, before returning to the Mediterranean in summer 2023.\n\nDuring a cruise in the Atlantic ocean in April 2023, a young woman fell off a balcony and fell on another person.

{"eng_Latn":"Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Goal 9 or SDG 9) is about \"industry, innovation and infrastructure\" and is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. SDG 9 aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.\n\nSDG 9 has eight targets, and progress is measured by twelve indicators. The first five targets are outcome targets: develop sustainable, resilient and inclusive infrastructures; promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization; increase access to financial services and markets; upgrade all industries and infrastructures for sustainability; enhance research and upgrade industrial technologies. The remaining three targets are means of implementation targets: Facilitate sustainable infrastructure development for developing countries; support domestic technology development and industrial diversification; universal access to information and communications technology.\n\nIn 2019, it was reported that \"the intensity of global carbon dioxide emissions has declined by nearly one quarter since 2000, showing a general decoupling of carbon dioxide emissions from GDP growth\". Millions of people are still unable to access the internet due to cost, coverage, and other reasons. It is estimated that just 54% of the world's population are currently (in 2020) internet users.\n\nBackground \nThe aim of attaining inclusive and sustainable industrialization is to \"unleash dynamic and competitive economic forces that generate employment and income\". This goal includes striving for resilience (engineering and construction) and urban resilience.\n\nSDG 9 recognizes that humanity's ability to connect and communicate effectively, move people and things efficiently, and develop new skills, industries and technology, is crucial in overcoming the many interlinked economic, social and environmental challenges in the 21st century.\n\nIn order to have a successful community, a functioning and strong infrastructure has to be in place as its basic requirement. SDG 9 is all about promoting innovative and sustainable technologies and ensuring equal and universal access to information and financial markets.\n\nThe technological development in infrastructure is what gives rise to a sustainable society. This is expected to create prosperity and jobs, and build stable and prosperous societies across the globe. The key emphasis is on developing reliable and sustainable infrastructural solutions that support economic development as well as human well-being, while also ensuring financial affordability. This goal aims at ensuring every society in the world possess good infrastructure.\n\nAchieving SDG 9 will require significant financing and political will. Key challenges include improving internet access in developing countries, inadequate transport, (particularly in land-locked developing countries) and the disparity of Research and Development investment and the number of researchers in developing countries when compared to developed countries.\n\nOutcome targets \nSDG 9 is broken down into 8 specific targets to reach the SDG goal. The first five targets are called 'outcome targets' (9.1-9.5), with the last three named 'means of achieving targets' (9.a-9.c). Outcome targets have specific desired outcomes that achieve the objective of the SDG goal. They are as follows: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, increase access to small scale enterprises, upgrade existing infrastructure, and enhance scientific research. . Each target includes one or more indicators that measure the achieved progress.\n\nTarget 9.1: Develop sustainable, resilient and inclusive infrastructures \n\nTarget 9.1 is: \"Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and trans-border infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and fair access for all\".\n\nIt has two indicators:\n\n \"Proportion of the rural population who live within 2 km of an all-season road\"\n \"Passenger and freight volumes, by mode of transport\"\n\nTarget 9.2: Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization \n\nTarget 9.2 is \"Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and by 2030, to raise significantly the industry's share of employment and GDP in line with national circumstances as well as to double its share in least developed countries\"\n\nIt has two indicators:\n\n \"Manufacturing value added as a proportion of GDP and per capita\"\n \"Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment\"\n\nManufacturing is a major source of employment. In 2016, the least developed countries had less \"manufacturing value added per capita.\" The figure for Europe and North America was US$4,621, compared to about $100 in the least developed countries.\n\nThe industry employment in the world hasn't drastically changed. In 1991, the industry employment made up around 21%  of total employment in the world, while in 2017, the industry employment made up 22% of total employment in the world.\n\nManufacturing employment is growing mostly in developing countries, while it declines in developed countries. In Germany, the manufacturing employment made up 47% of total employment in 1991, while it declined to 27% of total employment in 2017. In Kenya, the manufacturing employment made up 6% of total employment and has grown by two percent points to 8% in 2017.\n\nTarget 9.3: Increase access to financial services and markets \nTarget 9.3 is: \"Increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, particularly in developing countries, to financial services including affordable credit and their integration into value chains and markets\".\n\nIt has two indicators:\n\n \"Proportion of small-scale industries in total industry value-added\"\n \"Proportion of small-scale industries with a loan or line of credit\"\n\nAccording to a UN progress report from 2020, \"only 22% of small-scale industries in sub-Saharan Africa received loans or lines of credit, compared with 48% in Latin America and the Caribbean\".\n\nTarget 9.4: Upgrade all industries and infrastructures for sustainability \n\nTarget 9.4 is: \"By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities\".\n\nIt has only one indicator: \"CO2 emissions per unit of value added.\"\n\nAccording to a UN progress report from 2020, the \"intensity of global carbon dioxide emissions has declined by nearly one quarter since 2000, showing a general decoupling of carbon dioxide emissions from GDP growth\".\n\nTarget 9.5: Enhance research and upgrade industrial technologies \n\nTarget 9.5 is \"Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending.\"\n\nIt has two indicators:\n\n \"Research and development expenditure as a proportion of GDP\"\n \"Number of Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants\"\nIn Europe and North America, the number of researchers per 1 million people jumped to 3,372, and in sub-Saharan Africa, the number of researchers per million inhabitants was closer to 99  By 2018, women represented 33% of all researchers, although data are missing from some of the most populous countries.\n\nBy 2018, research and development constituted an average 1.79% of the global GDP according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. Although research expenditure rose in most regions between 2014 and 2018, 80% of countries still invested less than 1% of GDP in research and development by 2018. The G20 countries still accounted for nine-tenths of research expenditure, researchers, publications and patents.  In some cases, the researcher population rose faster than related expenditure, leaving less funding available to each researcher. Commitments to SDG 9.5 have not spurred an increase in reporting of data. On the contrary, a total of 99 countries reported data on domestic investment in research in 2015 but only 69 countries in 2018. Similarly, 59 countries recorded the number of researchers (in full-time equivalents) in 2018, down from 90 countries in 2015.\n\nMeans of implementation targets\n\nTarget 9.a: Facilitate sustainable infrastructure development for developing countries \nTarget 9.a is: \"Facilitate sustainable and resilient infrastructure development in developing countries through enhanced financial, technological and technical support to African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and Small Island Developing States.\"\n\nIt has one indicator: \"Total official international support (official development assistance plus other official flows) to infrastructure\".\n\nTarget 9.b: Support domestic technology development and industrial diversification \n\nTarget 9.b is: \"Support domestic technology development, research and innovation in developing countries, including by ensuring a conducive policy environment for, inter alia, industrial diversification and value addition to commodities\".\n\nIt has one indicator: \"Proportion of medium and high-tech industry value added in total value added\"\n\nTarget 9.c: Universal access to information and communications technology \nTarget 9.c is: \"Significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020\".\n\nIt has one indicator: \"Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, by technology\"\n\nMobile-cellular signal coverage is this target's indicator and has improved a great deal. In previously \"unconnected\" areas of the globe, 85 percent of people now live in covered areas. Planet-wide, 95% of the population was covered in 2017.\n\nMillions of people are still unable to access the internet due to cost, coverage, and other reasons. It is estimated that just 53% of the world's population are currently internet users. Estimates suggest that by the end of 2020, the world will have reached just 57% global internet use and 23% in least developed countries, missing target 9.c by a wide margin.\n\nChallenges\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic \nEven before the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, the world manufacturing growth was said to be declining. The pandemic hit industries hard and caused disruptions in value chains of goods and their supply, and has affected the digitization of business and services such as video conferencing, healthcare, teleworking etc.\n\nMonitoring \nHigh-level progress reports for all the SDGs are published in the form of reports by the United Nations Secretary General, the most recent one is from April 2020. The report before that was from May 2019. Updates and progress can also be found on the SDG website that is managed by the United Nations.\n\nCustodian agencies \n\nThe custodian agencies are responsible for data gathering and reporting on the indicators.

{"eng_Latn":"Beno\u00eet Verhaegen (1929\u20132009) was a Belgian academic and Africanist who specialised in the political sociology and post-colonial history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nBorn into a Belgian aristocratic family, Verhaegen fought as a volunteer in the Korean War. He embarked on an academic career after his return to Belgium and took up a post in the Belgian Congo in 1959 shortly before its independence. Verhaegen's progressive political views meant that he sympathised with African nationalism and he remained in the country on-and-off until 1987. He taught at various universities in the Congo which became Zaire in 1971 and he became increasingly influenced by Marxism and Maoism.\n\nVerhaegen's scholarly research was focused particularly on contemporary political movements in the Congo in the 1960s and 1970s. He termed his object of study \"immediate history\" (histoire imm\u00e9diate) and published a number of important articles, books, and collections of documents.\n\nEarly life and the Korean War\n\nBeno\u00eet Verhaegen was born into aristocratic family at Merelbeke, East Flanders in Belgium on 8 January 1929. He was the youngest son of Jean Verhaegen and his wife Simone Piers de Raveschoot. His grandfather, Arthur Verhaegen (18471917) had been a member of parliament for the Catholic Party and a leading exponent of Christian Democracy.\n\nVerhaegen was studying at the University of Ghent in August 1950, when he enlisted in the Belgian Volunteer Corps for Korea raised to participate in the Korean War. A few months earlier, South Korea had been invaded by communist North Korea and a coalition of military forces from the United Nations had been assembled to aid the South Koreans. Verhaegen served in the Korean War as a platoon commander and was twice wounded in action. He claimed his desire to fight in the conflict stemmed from his belief in an impending world war and a desire to live up to his family's tradition of military service. He later wrote a memoir of his experience during the conflict entitled A Season in Korea (Une saison en Cor\u00e9e).\n\nAfter returning from Korea, Verhaegen enrolled in the Catholic University of Leuven where he gained doctorates in law and economics with a thesis entitled \"Contribution to the Economic History of Flanders\". He gained a post as lecturer at Lovanium University at L\u00e9opoldville, Belgian Congo in 1959.\n\nAcademic career and the Congo\n\nVerhaegen arrived in the Belgian Congo in 1959 and remained in the country after independence in 1960, during the Congo Crisis at Lovanium. His politics had  become increasingly left-wing and \"progressive\" (progressiste) and he openly sympathised with the emerging African nationalist movement. Involved in nationalist politics, he served as chef de cabinet to Alo\u00efs Kabangi, Minister of Economic Co-ordination and Planning, in the Lumumba Government. However, he became increasing disenchanted with the established political groups during the crisis. Although remaining a Catholic, his views became increasingly radical over the course of his career and embraced Marxism and Maoism as a route towards agrarian socialism in the Congo.\n\nVerhaegen began researching political movements in the Congo in the aftermath of independence and formulated the idea of \"immediate history\" (histoire imm\u00e9diate) which mixed anthropological, historical, and sociological approaches to current events on an extensive documentary basis. He was involved in collecting documents published by contemporary political actors in the Congo and intended his work to be interacting with political actors. He wrote important studies on the Kwilu rebellion (196364), the nationalist leader Patrice Lumumba and the Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO) political party.\n\nTogether with Jules G\u00e9rard-Libois and , Verhaegen began involved in the new \"African section\" of the  (Centre de recherche et d'information socio-politiques, CRISP) in Belgium which published important series of documents on contemporary Congolese politics. This was disbanded in 1971 and Verhaegen became the director of the African Studies and Documentation Centre (Centre d\u2019\u00c9tudes et de Documentation africaines, CEDAF) which replaced it. He directed its journal series Cahiers du CEDAF which was superseded by Cahiers africains. He also led the creation of a historical research section at the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium.\n\nVerhaegen continued to teach at Lovanium but became critical of the \"colonial\" values he believed the institution embodied. He moved to Kisangani in 1971 as part of the consolidation of university education by the Mobutu regime under the National University of Zaire (Universit\u00e9 nationale du Za\u00efre, UNAZA). He founded the Interdisciplinary Research Centre for the Development of Education (Centre de Recherches interdisciplinaires pour le D\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019\u00c9ducation, CRIDE) and headed the university's social science section at Kisangani, later the University of Kisangani. He left the Congo in 1987 to return to academic roles in Belgium. He retired in 1990.\n\nA festschrift in Verhaegen's honour entitled Le Za\u00efre \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve de l'histoire imm\u00e9diate was published in 1993, and included contributions by Immanuel Wallerstein and Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch.\n\nRetirement\nOn 24 September 2001, Verhaegen was interrogated by the Belgian Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry regarding his role in the assassination of Lumumba. A note dated 12 September 1960 by the secretary of Belgian Minister without Portfolio Raymond Scheyven described the allocation of secret funds to several individuals, including Verhaegen. Anthropologist Anna Curtenius Roosevelt therefore concluded that \"secret agent Beno\u00eet Verhaegen was secretly paid millions during the crisis to help eliminate Lumumba and other nationalists.\" Verhaegen explained that those funds were contributions for the creation of an International Centre for Cooperation and was labeled 'secret' since diplomatic relations between Belgium and the Congo were broken off. According to Verhaegen, those funds were thus used to pay for the payment and accommodation of technical cooperants. In a commentary on the workings of the Commission of Inquiry, he criticised that they failed to verify their claims by going to the archive of the International Centre for Cooperation at the Foreign Affairs Archives. Belgian academic Gauthier de Villers believed that \"certain influential members of the group of experts or the Commission, too satisfied by being able to pinpoint in that way an engaged non-traditional and Marxist historian, were content with only doing a summary investigation.\"\n\nHe retired to France and died at Montr\u00e9al-les-Sources, Dr\u00f4me on 14 October 2009.\n\nSee also\n\nMerwin Crawford Young\nJan Vansina\nRen\u00e9 Lemarchand\nGeorges Balandier\nJean Suret-Canale\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n1929 births\nPeople from Merelbeke\n2009 deaths\nBelgian Africanists\nBelgian sociologists\n20th-century Belgian historians\nBelgian expatriates in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nAcademic staff of the National University of Zaire\nAcademic staff of Lovanium University\nCatholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968) alumni\nBelgian Marxist historians\nBelgian military personnel of the Korean War\nHistorians of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nBelgian expatriates in France\nBelgian political scientists\n20th-century political scientists"}

{"eng_Latn":"Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12 or Global Goal 12), titled \"responsible consumption and production\", is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015. The official wording of SDG 12 is  \"Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns\". SDG 12 is meant to ensure good use of resources, improve energy efficiency and sustainable infrastructure, provide access to basic services, create green and decent jobs, and ensure a better quality of life for all. SDG 12 has 11 targets to be achieved by at least 2030, and progress towards the targets is measured using 13 indicators.\n\nSustainable Development Goal 12 has 11 targets. The first 8 are outcome targets, which are: implement the 10\u2011Year Framework of Programs on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns; achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources; reducing by half the per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and the reduction of food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses; achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle; reducing waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse; encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices; promote public procurement practices that are sustainable; and ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development. The three means of implementation targets are: support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity; develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts; and remove market distortions, like fossil fuel subsidies, that encourage wasteful consumption.\n\nCountries are working towards the implementation of the \"10-Year Framework of\u202fProgrammes\u202fon Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns\".\n\nTo ensure that plastic products are more sustainable, thus reducing plastic waste, changes such as decreasing usage and increasing the circularity of the plastic economy are expected to be required. An increase in domestic recycling and a reduced reliance on the global plastic waste trade are other actions that might help meet the goal.\n\nBackground \nChanges in consumption and production patterns can help to promote the decoupling of economic growth and human well-being from resource use and environmental impact. They can also trigger the transformations envisaged in global commitments on biodiversity, the climate, and sustainable development in general.\n\nTargets, indicators and progress \n\nSDG 12 has 11 targets. Four of them are to be achieved by the year 2030, one by the year 2020, and six have no target years. The targets address different issues ranging from implementing the 10\u2011Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (Target 12.1), achieving the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources (Target 12.2), having per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels (Target 12.3), achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle (Target 12.4), substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse (Target 12.5), encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices (Target 12.6), promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities (Target 12.7), ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development (12.8), support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capabilities (Target 12.a), develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable grouwth (Target 12.b), rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions (Target 12.c).\n\nTarget 12.1: Implement the 10-year sustainable consumption and production framework \n\nThe full title of Target 12.1 is: \u201cImplement the 10\u2011Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries\". The goal of this SDG is to have all countries taking the action by 2030.\n\nIt has one indicator: Indicator 12.1.1 is the \"Number of countries with sustainable consumption and production (SCP) national action plans or SCP mainstreamed as a priority or a target into national policies\".\n\nMany countries are working towards the implementation of the \"10-Year Framework of\u202fProgrammes\u202fon Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns\".\n\nTarget 12.2: Sustainable management and use of natural resources \n\nThe full title of Target 12.2 is: \"By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources.\"\n\nThis target has two indicators:\n\n Indicator 12.2.1: Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP\n Indicator 12.2.2: Domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and domestic material consumption per GDP\nMaterial Footprint is the quantity of material extraction that is required to meet the consumption of a country. The sum of material footprint for biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metal ores is called the total material footprint. Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a production-side measure which does not account for supply chain inputs or exports, meaning a country could have a lower DMC value, if it outsources a large proportion of its materials.\n\nA report by the UN in 2020 found that: \"Global domestic material consumption per capita\u202frose by 7 per cent, from 10.8 metric tons per capita in 2010 to 11.7\u202fmetric tons\u202fin 2017, with increases\u202fin all regions\u202fexcept Northern America and Africa.\"\n\nTarget 12.3: Halve global per capita food waste \n\nThe full title of Target 12.3 is: \"By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses.\" This target has two components (losses and waste) measured by two indicators.\n\n Indicator 12.3.1.a: Food Loss Index which focuses on losses from production to consumption level \n Indicator 12.3.1.b: Food Waste Index this indicator is a proposal under development \nFAO and the United Nations Environment Programme measure progress towards this target.\n\nFAO found that \"globally around 14 percent of the world\u2019s food is lost from production before reaching the retail level\".\n\nTarget 12.4: Responsible management of chemicals and waste \n\nThe full title of Target 12.4 is: \"By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment.\"\n\nThis target has two indicators:\n\n Indicator 12.4.1: Number of parties to international multilateral environmental agreements on hazardous waste, and other chemicals that meet their commitments and obligations in transmitting information as required by each relevant agreement\n Indicator 12.4.2: (a) Hazardous waste generated per capita; and (b) proportion of hazardous waste treated, by type of treatment\n\nGlobal e-waste generation has grown during 2010\u202fto\u202f2019:\u202ffrom 5.3\u00a0kg\u202fper capita to 7.3\u00a0kg per capita. \u202fThe \"environmentally sound\u202frecycling of e-waste\" also increased: from 0.8\u00a0kg per capita to 1.3\u00a0kg per capita.\n\nTarget 12.5: Substantially reduce waste generation \n\nThe full title of Target 12.5 is: \"By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse.\"\n\nIt has one indicator: Indicator 12.5.1 is the \"National recycling rate, tons of material recycled\".\n\nEvery year, about one third of all food produce goes bad.

{"eng_Latn":"The Bully Pulpit: Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and the Golden Age of Journalism is a 909-page historical nonfiction book written by Doris Kearns Goodwin that was published by Simon & Schuster in November 2013. The book centers on the relationship of Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft and the activities of investigative journalists who impacted on public opinion during the Progressive Era. Upon its release, the book received positive reviews, with reviewers praising the research and readability, and won several accolades.\n\nBackground \nThe Bully Pulpit is the seventh book by Doris Kearns Goodwin. She spent seven years researching the book. Goodwin stated that initially she wished to write a history of the Progressive Era and Theodore Roosevelt, but determined Taft to be \"far more sympathetic if flawed\" than she first considered, which resulted in the book centering around the evolving relationship of Roosevelt and William Howard Taft.\n\nContents \n\nThe book covers the progressive period that transformed the United States at the turn of the century, and centers on the relationship of Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft as key players along with their wives, Edith Roosevelt and Nellie Taft, which evolved from friendship to rivalry. In parallel, it chronicles the activities of a group of writers working for McClure's Magazine, such as Ida Tarbell and Lincoln Steffens, who helped influence public opinion with their investigative journalism focusing on the increasing power of \"trusts\" and their associated abuses of power. The book also describes a perception of America that is different from our modern day perception.\n\nReception \nThe Bully Pulpit received positive reviews upon its release. Bill Keller from The New York Times praised the \"rich and elegant language\", and description of the relationships of other leaders, journalists and cabinet members with Roosevelt and Taft that resulted in \"most of her men and women with personality\" and for the story to \"come together like a well-wrought novel\". He also commented positively on the usage of detailed newspapers, magazines, and letters. This sentiment was shared by Publishers Weekly, which awarded a starred review, complimenting its relevance and the usage of quotes and letters used to show \"[t]he complex relationship and soured political camaraderie between Roosevelt and Taft\". Reviewing for the Booklist, Jay Freeman also gave a starred review, and described it as a \"superb re-creation of a period when many politicians, journalists, and citizens of differing political affiliations viewed government as a force for public good\". Another Booklist review by Alan Moores praised the book's details on Roosevelt and accessibility. Similarly, John Steele Gordon complimented that the book \"amply demonstrates\" Roosevelt's personality and the differences between him, its readability, research, as well as the Goodwin \"touchingly describing\" their meeting in 1918. Kirkus Reviews also gave a starred review, praising the book's coverage on investigative journalism and concluded that it was [a] notable, psychologically charged study in leadership\". \n\nBill Gates also recommend the book in his 2014 Summer Reading List, commenting positively on the theme of social change in the book. It also received several accolades, including the 2014 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Nonfiction and 2013 Booklist Editors' Choice for Adult Books.\n\nSee also\n Bully pulpit\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n2013 non-fiction books\nBooks about Theodore Roosevelt\nBooks by Doris Kearns Goodwin\nHistory books about the United States\nHistory books about the 20th century\nProgressive Era in the United States\nWilliam Howard Taft\nSimon & Schuster books"}

{"eng_Latn":"Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15 or Global Goal 15) is about \"Life on land\". One of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015, the official wording is: \"Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss\". The Goal has 12 targets to be achieved by 2030. Progress towards targets will be measured by 14 indicators.\n\nThe nine outcome targets include: Conserve and restore terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems; end deforestation and restore degraded forests; end desertification and restore degraded land; ensure conservation of mountain ecosystems, protect biodiversity and natural habitats; protect access to genetic resources and fair sharing of the benefits; eliminate poaching and trafficking of protected species; prevent invasive alien species on land and in water ecosystems; and integrate ecosystem and biodiversity in governmental planning. The three means of implementation targets include: Increase financial resources to conserve and sustainably use ecosystem and biodiversity; finance and incentivize sustainable forest management; combat global poaching and trafficking.\n\nAn annual report is prepared by the Secretary-General of the United Nations evaluating the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. It provides data on changes in forest areas, desertification, biodiversity loss and other parameters that are of relevance for SDG 15.\n\nTargets, indicators and progress \n\nThe UN has defined 12 Targets and 14 Indicators for SDG 15. Five of them are to be achieved by the year 2020, two by the year 2030 and the rest have no target year.\n\nEach of the targets also has one or more indicators to measure progress. In total there are fourteen indicators for SDG 15. FAO is the custodian agency for three of the indicators for SDG targets 15.1, 15.2 and 15.4.\n\nTarget 15.1: Conserve and restore terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems \nThe full title of Target 15.1 is: \"By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.\"\n\nThis target has two indicators: \n Indicator 15.1.1: Forest area as a proportion of the total land area \n Indicator 15.1.2: Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type\n\nForests cover roughly 4 billion hectares or 30.7 per cent of the world's land area. 93 percent are natural forests and 7 percent are planted. The forest area is defined by the land under natural or planted groups of trees of at least 5 meters in situ. The trees can be either be productive or non-productive and should not include fruit plantations and agroforestry systems and trees in urban parks and gardens. Protected areas are defined by three indicators: 1) the proportion of total terrestrial area classified as protected 2) the proportion of important sites of terrestrial biodiversity who are protected 3) and proportion of important sites of freshwater biodiversity that are protected.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly has defined Sustainable forest management as a dynamic and evolving concept that aims to maintain and enhance the economic, social and environmental values of all types of forests, for the benefit of present and future generations (Resolution A\/RES\/62\/98). It aims to find a balance between the increasing demands for forest products and the benefits as well as preserving the health and diversity of the forests.\n\nSDG indicator 15 is composed of five sub-indicators that measure progress towards all dimensions of sustainable forest management.

According to the expert group meeting in preparation for the High-level Political Forum of 2018, SDG 15 needs more indicators in areas such as forest intactness, management effectiveness of protected areas, and meaningful integration of biodiversity into other processes.\n\nChallenges \n\n, there is approximately a $700 billion gap in financial support to help low-income countries protect biodiversity.\n\nImpacts of COVID-19 pandemic \nIn 2020, there was brief progress on SDGs 12 to 15 on sustainable production and consumption, climate action and biodiversity conservation, but these gains were quickly offset once restrictions were lifted. This applies to CO\u2082 emissions, which declined in major economies during lockdowns, but went quickly back to their pre-pandamic levels after restrictions were lifted. It is estimated that deforestation increased by 12% from 2019 to 2020, and plastic consumption and waste may also increase during pandemic.\n\nLinks with other SDGs \nThe UN 17 sustainable development goals are inherently interconnected, most of the goals can be achieved only when others are also achieved. And achieving any individual goal tends to help the achievement of the other goals.\n\nThe impact of SDG 15 on gender equality (SDG 5) is also significant. In many parts of the world, women are farmers, especially poor women living in rural areas. They are the main labor force in growing crops, often depend on forests for fuel, fodder and food. Their limited ownership of the land reduces their ability to adapt to losses or decide how to use it. By protecting biodiversity and thus maintaining agricultural productivity, can also empower gender equality. When forest conditions and regeneration improve, women themselves will get a greater political voice.\n\nFor SDG 6 and SDG 7, the availability and quality of water from the functioning of ecosystems, especially forest ecological system. Protecting biodiversity, and maintaining the integrity of wetlands and forests play a huge role in the acquisition and replenishment of freshwater resources because natural ecosystems act as filters to clean water and protect it from diseases that can harm the animal or human health.\n\nSDG 15 has a direct link to SDG 8 includes high-yield agriculture and tourism, which attracts tourists through protected ecosystems and biodiverse environments, thereby enhancing economic returns.\n\nMaintaining biodiversity plays a vital role in helping to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Mangrove forests, for example, account for approximately 1% of carbon sequestration by the world's forests, but about 14% by the global ocean. Therefore, negative impacts on mangrove habitats can result in very high GHG emissions. The impact of land-based activities such as agriculture, land reclamation and urban development on ecosystems demonstrates the high degree of linkage between SDG 13, SDG 14 and SDG 15, and the importance of the overall management of all three.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n UN Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform \u2013 SDG 15\n \u201cGlobal Goals\u201d Campaign - SDG 15 \n SDG-Track.org - SDG 15\n UN SDG 15 in the US\n\nSustainable Development Goals\nUnited Nations documents\n2015 establishments in New York City\nProjects established in 2015\nNature conservation"}

{"eng_Latn":"Ferdinand Marcos developed a cult of personality as a way of remaining President of the Philippines for 20 years, in a way that political scientists have compared to other authoritarian and totalitarian leaders such as Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler, but also to more contemporary dictators such as Suharto in Indonesia, Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and the Kim dynasty of North Korea.\n\nThe propaganda techniques used, either by himself or by others, to mythologize Ferdinand Marcos, began with local political machinations in Ilocos Norte while Ferdinand was still the young son of politician and Japanese collaborator Mariano Marcos, and persist today in the efforts to revise the way Marcos is portrayed in Philippine history. According to members of his administration, such as Adrian Cristobal, Marcos's intent was to project an image of himself \"the only patron, the king\" of Philippine society, which he still saw as a society of tribes.\" Cristobal furthers that \"Marcos and the First Lady wanted more than anything else [...] to be king and queen. They wished to shape the kingdom in their own image; [...] Marcos wanted to be able to say, 'L'\u00e9tat c'est moi.'\" In some extreme cases where Marcos encouraged the formation of cults so that they could serve as a political weapon, Marcos came to be thought of as a God.\n\nThese propaganda narratives and techniques include: using red scare tactics such as red-tagging to portray activists as communists and to exaggerate the threat represented by the Communist Party of the Philippines; using martial law to take control of mass media and silence criticism; the use of foreign-funded government development projects and construction projects as propaganda tools; creating an entire propaganda framework around a \"new society\" in which he would rule under a system of \"constitutional authoritarianism\"; the perpetuation of hagiographical books and films; the perpetuation of propaganda narratives about Marcos's activities during World War II, which have since been proven false by historical documents; the creation of myths and stories around himself and his family; and portrayals of himself in coinage and even a Mount Rushmore type monument; among others.\"\n\nSince Ferdinand Marcos's death, propaganda efforts have been made to whitewash his place in Philippine history, an act of historical negationism commonly referred to using the more popular term \"historical revisionism.\"\n\nTerminology \nWhile the widely used term for a supporter of Ferdinand Marcos or the other members of the Marcos family is \"Marcos loyalist,\" the term \"cult of personality\" around Ferdinand Marcos is often used not to refer to people specifically, but in a broader sense to the mechanism, including the techniques and structures, used to create a heroic or idealized image of Marcos as a ruler. Meanwhile, the term \"Marcos revisionism\" or \"Marcos Historical negationism\" have been used to refer to the Marcos family's propaganda after their return to Philippine politics, specifically to those materials intended to distort or reframe the historical facts of Marcos's life and rule.\n\nEarly political career (1949\u20131965)\n\nClientelism \n\nAs with most Philippine politicians of his era Ferdinand Marcos achieved success largely by taking advantage of the client-patron relationships which dominated Philippine politics after Philippine independence.\n\nAmong Ilocos politicians \nOnce he achieved government authority, he used it to reward his supporters while limiting the power of other social groups and institutions.\nHe styled himself as the Ilocos region's ticket to political prominence. In his first campaign, running for congressman of his family's already-established bailiwick, Ilocos Norte, \"This is only a first step. Elect me a congressman now, and I pledge you an Ilocano president in 20 years.\"\n\nIn the Philippine military \nOn a more personal level, Marcos established relationships with the graduate officers and junior officers of the Philippine Military Academy early on. When he became president, Marcos appointed mostly Ilocano commanders to head the armed forces, such that 18 out of 22 generals of the Philippine Constabulary came from the Ilocos region and House Speaker Jose B. Laurel was alarmed enough to file a 1968 bill calling for the equal representation of all regions in the armed forces.\n\nAmong the Marcos cronies \n\nHe also established a small group of supporters in the business sector, whom he would later enable to establish monopolies in key economic sectors, wresting control from the political families which held them prior.\n\nExaggerations of WWII exploits \n\nOne early propaganda technique used by Marcos was to exaggerate his wartime activities during World War II.\n\nMarcos claimed to have led a guerrilla force called Ang Mah\u00e1rlika (Tagalog, \"The Freeman\") in northern Luzon after the fall of Bataan. According to Marcos's claim, this force had a strength of 9,000 men. His account of events was later cast into doubt after a United States military investigation that exposed many of his claims as either false or inaccurate. Meanwhile, Marcos claimed that he was able to get the United States Adjutant General to recognize 3,500 individual claims of soldiers then under his command. Marcos also used Maharlika as his personal nom de guerre, and in 1970, a film entitled Maharlika was produced to feature his \"war exploits\". Communications from American military officers detailed their disapproval in recognizing the guerrilla unit. A memorandum sent to the Adjutant General, Lt. Col. Parker Calvert relayed the order of Col. Russell Volckmann to inform Marcos that his request for release from the 14th Infantry to rejoin his guerrilla group was disapproved. This was precisely because the \"Ang Manga Maharlika\" was not among the units recognized by the higher headquarters of the military. This was reiterated by Major R.G. Langham on behalf of the Regimental Commander of the 5th Cavalry. In a May 1945 memorandum, Langham wrote to the Commanding General for Ang Mga Maharlika not to be \"recommended for recognition because of the limited military value of their duties.\"\n\nIn 1962, Marcos would claim to be the \"most decorated war hero of the Philippines\" by garnering almost every medal and decoration that the Filipino and American governments could give to a soldier. Among his 27 supposed war medals and decorations were the Distinguished Service Cross (allegedly pinned by General Douglas MacArthur) and the Medal of Honor (allegedly pinned by General Jonathan M. Wainwright).\n\nResearchers later found that stories about the wartime exploits of Marcos were mostly propaganda, being inaccurate or untrue. The following discredit the claims made about his supposed exploits: \n Marcos was not on General Douglas MacArthur's \"List of Recipients of Awards and Decorations\" issued from December 7, 1941, to June 30, 1945, that was compiled in Tokyo, nor on General Jonathan Wainwright's list of 120 Americans and Filipinos who were awarded during the Bataan campaign by the War Department shortly before his surrender. \n Colonel Manriquez and Adjutant Captain Rivera who were the commanders of the 14th Infantry, whom Marcos claimed to have served under, attested that Marcos was not a soldier, but was a noncombatant and a Civil Affairs officer. Marcos only received campaign ribbons given to all combatant and noncombatant participants \"in the defense of Bataan and in the resistance.\" \n Marcos's claim of having received the Order of the Purple Heart has also been shown to have been false. His name does not appear on the official roster of recipients.\n\nIn 1986, research by historian Alfred W. McCoy into United States Army records showed that most of Marcos's medals were fraudulent. According to Dr. Ricardo T. Jose, former chair of the department of history of the University of the Philippines, Marcos's claims in his self-commissioned autobiography Marcos of the Philippines that Gen. Douglas MacArthur pinned on him the Distinguished Service Cross medal for delaying Japanese at Bataan for 3 months was highly improbable. Marcos claimed he received the medal from MacArthur in 1945, but the latter, following his retreat to Bataan, then to Australia, was only able to return to the Philippines in 1944, when his troops landed in Leyte. The following year, after the surrender of Japan, MacArthur was installed as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces and was tasked with demobilizing Japan and framing its constitution, allowing little to no time to meet Marcos. No archival sources or published works related to MacArthur allude to him personally pinning the medal on Marcos as well. Jose further said that if Marcos did indeed single-handedly delay the advances of the Japanese, he would have likely been bestowed with the Medal of Honor, as was the case with Jose Calugas, whose actions in 1942 impeded Japanese forces by two days. Indeed, as of August 2021, searching through the list of recipients of the Medal of Honor, Purple Heart, and Silver Star yields no result for Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nJohn Sharkey of The Washington Post found records that Marcos was on the list of those that were released due to either \"having severe health problems and those whose families have cooperated with the Japanese military authorities.\" Since Marcos's name did not appear in the 1942 Manila Tribune list of ailing prisoners that were released by the Japanese, Sharkey believed that Marcos may have been freed due to his connections with his father. Mariano Marcos was known to have collaborated with Japanese authorities, and at the end of the war was caught by Filipino guerrillas and was tied to four water buffalos and was quartered. His remains were also displayed in public by the guerrillas.\n\nFerdinand Marcos in turn had strong affiliations with the Japanese-sponsored President Jose P. Laurel. There are accounts of Marcos being a member of Presidential Security Group. It was Laurel who single-handedly penned the reversal of the conviction of the young Marcos's case over the murder of Julio Nalundasan. American guerrillas who operated in the Ilocos region, the likes of Robert Lapham also wrote that Ferdinand Marcos was not a guerrilla leader of a group called Ang Maharlika, but a Japanese collaborator propagandist.\n\nElection propaganda book and film \n\nA notable propaganda technique used by both candidates in the 1965 Philippine presidential election was the use of hagiographies, so much so that it was dubbed a \"battle of books and film.\" Marcos was the first to use this tactic with the book \"For Every Tear a Victory: The Story of Ferdinand E. Marcos,\" which was quickly followed by a film adaptation \"Iginuhit ng Tadhana (Written by Destiny).\" One of the highlights of the film was that it portrayed Ferdinand Marcos's alibi for the murder of Julio Nalundasan; the film showed how Ferdinand was supposedly studying for his law classes at the time. Historian Vicente Rafael argued that Marcos use the film to establish the idea that he is destined to lead the Philippines. Diosdado Macapagal countered with his own propaganda film, \"Daigdig ng Mga Api (World of the Oppressed),\" but it was Marcos who won the election.\n\nMarcos repeated this strategy in the 1969 elections through the film \"Pinagbuklod ng Langit\". The film chronicles the life of the Ferdinand Marcos and his family while living in Malacanang Palace. Another film that Marcos commissioned before the 1969 elections is Maharlika. The film is loosely based on Marcos' exaggerated wartime exploits. It features Paul Burke as Marcos stand-in Bob Reynolds, who leads a group of guerrillas called Ang Mga Maharlika against the Japanese. It was completed in 1970 but was not released in theaters due to Marcos' love-affair with the film's lead actress Dovie Beams. It was finally released in 1987 as Guerilla Strike Force to negative reviews and poor box office performance.\n\nFirst two presidential terms (1965\u20131972)\n\nEarly \"Macho\" persona \nGenerally recognized as a \"master of populist imagery,\" Marcos actively sought to create a \"macho\" image, associating his public image with symbols of masculinity, indirectly through stories of wartime escapades and by making sure he was photographed joining farmers in planting their rice crops; and more directly by casting himself in masculine roles in commissioned works of art, including poems, paintings, and photographs.\n\nMarcos also associated himself and his wife Imelda with the Filipino creation myth of \"Malakas and Maganda.\" One often-cited instance of this was an Evan Cosayco painting the couple commissioned in which Marcos was portrayed as the muscular Adam-figure Malakas (\"malakas\" means strong in the Tagalog language), and Imelda was portrayed as the pure and beautiful Eve-figure Maganda (\"maganda\" means \"beautiful\" in Tagalog).\n\nPresidential Arm on Community Development \nIn an effort to strengthen the influence of the Office of the President and simultaneously weaken the strong patronage bonds which rural Filipinos had with their local leaders, Marcos created the \"Presidential Arm on Community Development\" (PACD), which would initiate development projects at the barrio level without going through the Barrio and Municipal governments.\n\nConstruction projects as propaganda \n\nMarcos projected himself to the Philippine public as having spent a lot on construction projects. This focus on infrastructure, which critics saw as a propaganda technique, eventually earned the colloquial label \"edifice complex\".\n\nMost of these infrastructure projects and monuments were paid for using foreign currency loans and at great taxpayer cost. This greatly increased the Philippines's foreign deficit \u2013 from $360\u00a0million when Marcos became president, to around $28.3\u00a0billion when he was overthrown.\n\nThe earliest examples of the Marcos era edifice complex projects include the buildings of the Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex (conceived in 1966), and the San Juanico Bridge (conceived in 1969). Later examples include the Philippine International Convention Center (conceived in 1974), the Philippine Heart Center (conceived in 1975), the National Arts Center in Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna (inaugurated in 1976), the Coconut Palace (conceived in 1978), the Lung Center of the Philippines (conceived in 1981), the National Kidney and Transplant Institute (conceived in 1981), and Terminal 1 of Manila International Airport (completed in 1981). The \"designer hospitals\" were particularly criticized as wrongly prioritized healthcare projects, draining public funds for the benefit of only a handful of patients, while underfunded basic health institutions, such as the Quezon Institute for Tuberculosis Patients, were overflowing and underfunded.\n\nThe 1976 Tondo evictions which were part of the \"Tondo Urban Renewal Project\" and the deaths of construction workers at the Manila Film Center are also associated with the \"edifice complex\" phenomenon.\n\n\"Red scare\" tactics \n\nWhen Marcos became president in 1965, Philippine policy and politics functioned under a post\u2013World War II geopolitical framework. After gaining independence from the US after the war, the Philippines had retained strong economic, political and military ties to the United States, manifested in a mutual defense treaty, military assistance agreement, a US military advisory group, and the presence of bases where the US military could conduct \"unhampered US military operations\" for 99 years (later reduced to 50). Filipino presidents were very politically dependent on US Support, and this did not change until the end of the Cold War in 1989, and the termination of the 1947 US Military Bases Treaty, in 1992.\n\nWith its close ties to the US, the Philippines was ideologically caught up in the anticommunist scare perpetuated by the US during the Cold War. The government was not yet strongly-established, and it was \"fearful of being swept away by [communism]'s rising tide\", so in 1957, it passed Republic Act No. 1700, known as the \"Anti-Subversion Act of 1957\", which made mere membership in any communist party illegal. The Philippines would take three and a half decades to repeal it, through Republic Act 7636, in 1992.\n\nThe Anti-Subversion Act was originally meant to counter the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (PKP) and its armed force, the Hukbalahap, also called the Huks. The campaign against the PKP and the Huks was bloody, but it had basically ended by 1954. Throughout the 1960s, the remnants of the PKP pursued \"a course of peaceful action\" while working to rebuild their organization, but, this was later challenged by a youth-based Maoist group within the organization created by university professor Jose Maria Sison, who joined the PKP in 1962. Clashing with the PKP party leaders's view that armed struggle was an exercise in futility, Sison and his group were expelled from the PKP in 1967, and on December 26, 1968, founded the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) along Maoist lines. While the PKP sought to marginalize this new group, it soon became the leading communist party in the Philippines.\n\nBy the time Marcos became president in 1965, the PKP was a weakened organization, and the Hukbalahap reduced to \"what amounted to banditry.\" But Marcos immediately made noise about the supposed \"communist threat\" \u2013 drawing on images of the bloody Huk encounters of the 1950s, and courting the Johnson administration's political support in light of the Us's recent entry into the Vietnam war.\n\nMarcos continued using communism as bogeyman after 1968, as the PKP faded into obscurity and the nascent CPP became more prominent. The Armed Forces of the Philippines did likewise in 1969, when the CPP allied with Huk commander Bernabe Buscayno to create the nascent New People's Army (NPA). Although the NPA was only a small force at the time, the AFP hyped up its formation, partly because doing so was good for building up the AFP budget. As a result, notes Security Specialist Richard J. Kessler, \"the AFP mythologized the group, investing it with a revolutionary aura that ony attracted more supporters.\"\n\nEven in the days immediately before Marcos's declaration of Martial Law on September 23, 1972, the Philippine National Security Council did not consider the two communist movements to represent a sizable threat. At around that time, the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations received notice that as of September 19, 1972, the Philippine Council had set their threat assessment at \"between 'normal' and 'Internal Defense Condition 1'\" on a scale where 3 was the highest Defense condition. One of the generals serving under General Fabian Ver of the National Intelligence and Security Authority later recalled that \"even when Martial Law was declared, the communists were not a real threat. The military could handle them.\"\n\n\"Today's Revolution: Democracy\" \n1971 saw the publication of \"Today's Revolution: Democracy,\" purportedly written by Marcos himself but later revealed to have been written by ghostwriter.\n\nNoted as an early effort to lay down the justifications for martial law, \"Today's Revolution: Democracy\" portrayed Marcos as heroically trying to create a viable economy despite opposition from his supposed enemies: communists, \"oligarch families\" and elitist politicians. Coming on the heels of the First Quarter Storm, it was also an effort to capture the discourse of \"Unfinished Revolution\" which was the catchphrase of the activist youth of the period, attempting to project Marcos as the rightful heir to the Philippine Revolution.\n\nDuring Martial Law (1972\u20131981)\n\nAn ideology of \"constitutional authoritarianism\" \n\nAmong Marcos's rationalizations for the declaration of martial law were the linked ideologies of the \"Bagong Lipunan\" (\"new society\") and of \"constitutional authoritarianism.\"\n\nMarcos said that there was a need to \"reform society\" by placing it under the control of a \"benevolent dictator\" in a \"constitutional authority\" which could guide the undisciplined populace through a period of chaos.\n\nSocial engineering under the \"Bagong Lipunan\" \nPresident Marcos supported the ideology of \"constitutional authoritarianism\" with various exercises in social engineering, united under the banner of the \"bagong lipunan\" or \"new society.\"\n\nThe Philippine education system underwent a major period of restructuring in after the declaration of Martial Law in 1972, in which the teaching of civics and history was reoriented so that it would reflect values which supported the Bagong Lipunan and its ideology of constitutional authoritarianism. In addition, it attempted to synchronize the educational curriculum with the administration's economic strategy of labor export.\n\nThe Marcos administration also produced an array of propaganda materials \u2013 including speeches, books, lectures, slogans, and numerous propaganda songs \u2013 to promote it.\n\nControl of mass media \nMarcos took control of the mass media to silence public criticism during what was considered the \"dark days of martial law.\" Upon declaring martial law, Marcos arrested journalists and took control of media outlets. This allowed him to dictate what information and opinions were published or broadcast. Through the crony press, the Marcos dictatorship suppressed negative news and exaggerated positive news, thus creating a perception of progress and relative calm in the earlier part of martial law.\n\nAccording to journalism professor Luis Teodoro, the martial law period savaged the Bill of Rights and institutions of liberal democracy, such as the press. Challenges to the dictatorship in the media would come from the underground press and, later on, from the above-ground mosquito press.\n\nShutdown of media outlets and the attack on journalists \nOn the morning of September 23, 1972, Marcos's soldiers arrested journalists and raided and padlocked media outlets across the Philippines. Joaquin Roces, Teodoro Locsin Sr., Maximo Soliven, Amando Doronila, and other members of the media were rounded up and detained in Camp Crame together with members of the political opposition.\n\nMarcos's order to take over newspapers, magazines, radio and television facilities under Letter of Instruction No. 1 was done with the express purpose of preventing the undermining of the people's faith and confidence\u00a0in the regime.\n\nDuring martial law, in another blow to press freedom, Marcos ordered shut down 7 major English and 3 Filipino newspapers, 1 English-Filipino newspaper, 11 English weekly magazines, 1 Spanish daily, 4 Chinese newspapers, 3 business publications, 1 news service, 7 television stations, 66 community newspapers, and 292 radio stations around the country. Journalists were jailed, tortured, killed, or \"disappeared\" by the dictatorship.\n\nThe crony press and censorship \nThe dictatorship also exercised blanket censorship through Letter of Instruction No. 1 and the Department of Public Information's Order No. 1, issued on September 25, 1972. Only news outlets owned by Marcos's cronies were allowed to resume operations, such as the Philippine Daily Express owned by crony Roberto Benedicto.\n\nRewriting of Philippine history\n\nThe \"Apo\" persona\nTaking off from his early efforts to portray himself as a virile, macho figure, Marcos later associated himself with idealized images of the leaders of precolonial Philippine settlements \u2013 the \"Apo\", \"Datu\", \"Rajah\" ,and \"Lakan\". And he furthered this image of himself as the strong masculine leader by glamorizing the early historical Barangay settlements and the Maharlika warrior class.\n\nThe \"Tadhana\" History Project \nIn the 1970s, the Marcos administration embarked on a project to publish multi-volume \"new history of the Filipino people\" called \"Tadhana\" (Destiny) which, along with the ideology of constitutional authoritarianism and Marcos's efforts to cast himself in the vein of the archipelago's precolonial leaders, was intended to help lend legitimacy to the legitimacy of Marcos's authoritarian rule. Three volumes from the project, which was never completed, were eventually published \u2013 with Volume 1 and 2 published in several separate parts in 1976, 1977, and 1980, and a \"compressed\" volume published under the title \"Tadhana: The Formation of the National Community (1565\u20131896)\" published in 1976.\n\nHistoriographers agree that the publication of Tadhana did contribute to the growth of the discourse of Philippine history, but that the project was ultimately flawed due to its explicitly political nature.\n\nPropaganda as \"The King of Maharlika\" \nMarcos's purpose in rewriting Philippine history is expounded upon by his primary speechwriter, Adrian Cristobal, as quoted by journalist Ian Baruma:\n\nMarcos sees the Philippines as a society of tribes. And he sees himself as the great tribal chief, the \"datu\" of pre-Spanish times. He destroyed much of the old network of family and regional loyalties to become the one and only patron, the king of Maharlika.\n\nBaruma further cited Cristobal, saying \"\u2026what Marcos and the First Lady wanted more than anything else was to be king and queen. They wished to shape the kingdom in their own image; like the Sun King, Louis XIV, Marcos wanted to be able to say, 'L'\u00e9tat c'est moi.'\"\n\nMartial law propaganda books \n\"Today's Revolution:Democracy\" was later followed by several books published under Marcos's name from 1970 to 1983, which are believed to have been written by ghostwriters, notably Adrian Cristobal.\n\nOne final book would be published after his death, in 1990.\n\nThe five peso Bagong Lipunan coin \n\nFrom 1975 to 1982, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) introduced a five peso coin in line with the new 'Ang Bagong Lipunan' series issued in commemoration of Marcos's declaration of Martial Law. The obverse bears the inscription 'Ang Bagong Lipunan,' year of minting, and a profile of Marcos, who was the president throughout the circulation of the coins, faced to the left. Marcos himself approved the coins with his own face. The denomination, the inscription 'Republika ng Pilipinas', and the official coat of arms are all on the reverse. The coin along with the other denominations of the Ang Bagong Lipunan Series were demonetized by the BSP on January 2, 1998.\n\nThe Marcos bust \n\nAmong the most prominent symbols of Marcos's rule over the Philippines was the 30-metre (98 ft) concrete bust of himself constructed in 1978 by the Philippine Tourism Authority near the peak of Mt. Shontoug in Tuba, Benguet, along the Aspiras-Palispis Highway on the tourist route to Baguio. Controversial as a symbol of self-glorification, its construction was noted for having displaced indigenous Ibaloi from their lands.\n\nThe bust was destroyed on December 29, 2002, by suspected treasure hunters who thought that the bust contained parts of the rumored Yamashita treasure, although early speculation was that the New People's Army was behind the bombing of the monument.\n\nDuring the Fourth Republic (1981\u20131986)\n\nConcealing of illness \nTowards the end of his 21-year administration, Marcos's health began to degrade. But because he had built his image around the mythical Filipino Adam-figure \"Malakas,\" his administration continued to portray him as a \"Filipino superman,\" going to great lengths to conceal his illnesses.\n\nGlobal Reputation\nIt is also common among Marcos propagandist and historical revisionist to portray Marcos as \"the only President who stood up against the United States of America.\" This is a post-colonial mindset makes a presumption that the Philippines was not respected among the community of nations, and portray Marcos as a foreign policy genius. However, one can clearly look at the relations of Marcos and the various US presidency, especially with Ronald Reagan and it was clear that Marcos deferred to Washington during the latter part of his presidency. It was CIA Director Adm. William Casey himself who suggested that Marcos should hold a snap election, and Sen. Paul Laxalt during the last night of the EDSA Revolution for Marcos to \"Cut. Cut clean. The time has come.\"\n\nInterestingly, Marcos in 1988 published his own account of the EDSA Revolution titled \"A Trilogy on the Transformation of Philippine Society.\" Marcos himself would write that he would consult the US Ambassador Stephen Bosworth and Washington on critical decisions that came about in the early part of 1986.\n\nDistortionism and propaganda after Marcos's death \n\nAfter Ferdinand Marcos's death in 1989, propaganda efforts have been made to whitewash his place in Philippine history and facilitate the Marcos family's return to power \u2013 an act which human rights advocates and historiographers refer to as historical distortionism or historical denialism (often wrongly using the academically imprecise term \"historical revisionism\").\n\nAt first, this mostly involved simple denial or trivializing of the human rights violations and economic plunder that took place during the Marcos administration, as well as the role played by the Marcos children in the administration.\n\nWith the popularization of social media during the 2010s, several bloggers and content creators have made videos and articles supposedly debunking the corruption and atrocities of Marcos. Notable examples include the political blog Get Real Philippines and YouTube channel Pinoy Monkey Pride. A 2018 study later discovered that these efforts at historical distortion were linked to a \"professionalized and hierarchized group of political operators,\" with advertising and Public Relations executives at the top, \"who design disinformation campaigns, mobilize click armies, and execute innovative \"digital black ops\" and \"signal scrambling\" techniques for any interested political client.\"\n\nHistorical denialism \nAfter Ferdinand Marcos's death, the remaining members of the Marcos family returned to the Philippines and re-entered politics and public life. They and their followers have been noted for instances of historical revisionism, and the denial or trivializing of the human rights violations and economic plunder that took place during the Marcos administration, as well as the role played by the Marcos children in the administration.\n\nDistortionism and disinformation efforts\n\nOrganized \"networked disinformation\" \n\nIn 2018, Dr. Jason Caba\u00f1es of the University of Leeds School of Media and Communication and Dr. Jonathan Corpus Ong of the University of Massachusetts Amherst released a study of organized disinformation efforts in the Philippines, titled \"Architects of Networked Disinformation: Behind the Scenes of Troll Accounts and Fake News Production in the Philippines.\" Based on participant observation in Facebook community groups and Twitter accounts, as well as key informant interviews with 20 \"disinformation architects,\" conducted from December 2016 to December 2017, the study described a \"professionalized and hierarchized group of political operators who design disinformation campaigns, mobilize click armies, and execute innovative \"digital black ops\" and \"signal scrambling\" techniques for any interested political client.\" This network had \"ad and PR strategists at the top.\"\n\nOne of the revelations from the Ong and Caba\u00f1es's 2018 study was that techniques for \"personal branding\" were used to \"tell a revisionist account of the 20-year Marcos regime as 'the golden age of the Philippines,'\" using such tools as YouTube videos \"in a bid to restore the political luster of the Marcos family.\"\n\nIt also revealed the existence of \"Ilibing Na\" (\"Bury now\") campaign designed to create public support for a hero's burial for Ferdinand Marcos using \"diversionary tactics to elude allegations of human rights violations and corruption during the term of Ferdinand Marcos\" and launching \"digital black ops that targeted prominent critics\" of the Marcoses, particularly vice president Leni Robredo.\n\nSpread of disinformation using social media \nAlthough there is a perception that disinformation about the Marcos regime comes mostly from \"propaganda books\" written by Marcos allies, a 2020 study noted that an estimated 72% of confirmed Marcos disinformation originated directly from social media, rather than print sources.\n\nThe study examined 119 claims about the Marcoses which had been debunked by various news organizations. The study found that 21% of these were \"distributed via social media\" and \"not attributable to pro-Marcos books\"; 20% of them came from a person quoted by Media, which cannot traced to a preexisting text; and about 31% were about recent events. Only about 15% could be traced to text in various propaganda books, while a remaining 13% consisted of \"general claims.\"\n\nCommon propaganda narratives\n\n\"Golden Age\" propaganda \n\nVarious Marcos supporters, most notably his immediate family, have also denied the negative economic impacts of authoritarian rule, and of Marcos's policies specifically, portraying the initial gains in the period immediately following the declaration of Martial Law as proof of a Philippine economic \"golden age\" while downplaying the series of economic collapses that began in the mid to late 1970s.\n\nThe 2018 study of Networked Disinformation by Ong and Caba\u00f1es has identified \"Golden age\" propaganda as one of the tactics used by professional propagandists to further the political comeback of the Marcos siblings during the mid-2010s. Investigative journalists and media organizations have also agreed that \"Golden age\" propaganda as intentional disinformation.\n\nThe propagation of \"Golden age\" propaganda has led numerous groups of economists, historians, and other academics to debunk it, but some reports have noted that the use of \"deceptive nostalgia\" as propaganda has been effective in misleading the public.\n\n\"Regional military power\" propaganda \n\nThe Philippines was not a regional military power during the Marcos years but neither was it the weakest, with the Armed Forces of the Philippines saying it \"was one of the most well-equipped militaries in Asia\" at that time. While Marcos did invest a lot in the military during his term, other countries in Asia such as Thailand Cambodia were ahead of the Philippines in terms of military capabilities at that time. The Philippines also depended greatly on the United States for its own external defense then.\n\nAccording to a 2004 paper by Andrew Tan for the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies Singapore, the militaries of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines \"could be described as militarily weak, with small numbers of major weapon systems.\" Tan, a strategic analyst who specializes in defense and security studies, cites \"The Military Balance 1974\u201375\" for a snapshot of military capabilities of Southeast Asian states in 1974 that shows the Philippines trailing Thailand in personnel, 274,000 to 396,000.\n\nThe AFP was also behind the militaries of Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Singapore in combat aircraft. The Philippine Air Force had 36 aircraft units in 1974, putting at par with Malaysia. Thailand had 105 combat aircraft. Laos, which was fighting a civil war at the time, had 85 planes, with \"most of the combat aircraft consisted of US-supplied T-28 ground attack aircraft,\" wrote Tan. Singapore had 65 and Cambodia had 64.\n\nIn a joint 1973 study conducted by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), America's security establishment also said that the \"Philippines has little capability to provide material for its armed forces\u2026. All other military material is imported primarily through the US Military Assistance Program.\" The joint DIA-CIA study noted as well that the Philippine military has been \"plagued continuously by serious deficiencies in their supply and maintenance system, including an ineffective accounting system, haphazard distribution, inadequate storage facilities, and poor maintenance.\"\n\nA 2017 article published by the Philippine Star also said US military presence, particularly in Clark and Subic, and the assistance resulting from that presence represented the \"biggest weapons in Marcos's arsenal\".\n\n\"Tallano gold\" social media propaganda \nThere are social media posts that falsely claim that Marcos and an associate were paid 640,000 metric tons in gold by a client in 1949, supposedly making them the richest men in the world. The gold was supposedly paid to Marcos by the Tallano royal family, who is said to have ruled over a kingdom called Maharlika before Spain colonized the Philippines. However, there are no historical documents that will substantiate that a royal family called Tallano ruled over a kingdom called Maharlika or that Marcos lawyered for such a family.\n\nSee also \n\n Ferdinand Marcos\n Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos\n Edifice complex\n Sa ikauunlad ng bayan, disiplina ang kailangan\n Bagong Pagsilang\n List of cults of personality\n Stalin's cult of personality\n Xi Jinping's cult of personality\n North Korean cult of personality\n Adolf Hitler's cult of personality\n Rolex 12\n Bongbong Marcos\n Marcos Family\n Cacique democracy\n Diehard Duterte Supporters\n Trumpism \n Fujimorism\n\nReferences \n\nCults of personality\nCult of personality\nPresidency of Ferdinand Marcos\nFeudalism"}
{"eng_Latn":"The NEC \u03bcCOM series is a series of microprocessors and microcontrollers manufactured by NEC in the 1970s and 1980s. The initial entries in the series were custom-designed 4 and 16-bit designs, but later models in the series were mostly based on the Intel 8080 and Zilog Z80 8-bit designs, and later, the Intel 8086 16-bit design. Most of the line was replaced in 1984 by the NEC V20, an Intel 8088 clone.\n\nOverview \n\nThe \u03bcCOM series has its roots in one of the world's earliest microprocessor chipsets, the two-chip processor \u00b5PD707 \/ \u00b5PD708. Early in 1970, Coca Cola Japan set out to increase the efficiency of their sales outlets by introducing new POS terminals. Sharp was contracted to build these terminals, and NEC in turn to develop a chipset. The chipset development was complete in December 1971, at about the same time as other early microprocessors in the USA.\n\nSince then, NEC has developed and manufactured various microprocessors and microcontrollers. General-purpose products among them were given series names starting with \u03bcCOM. The \u03bcCOM-4 series (4 bit) and \u03bcCOM-16 series (16 bit) were original developments, while the \u03bcCOM-8 series (8 bit and 16 bit) consisted mostly of Intel- and Zilog-compatible microprocessors.\n\nThe \u03bcCOM name disappeared when the V series and 78K series appeared in the 1980s, and the \u03bcCOM-87AD series, for example, came to be described simply as the 87AD series.\n\n\u03bcCOM-4 series\n\n\u03bcCOM-4 \nThe \u03bcCOM-4 (\u03bcPD751) is NEC's original single-chip 4-bit microprocessor, announced in 1973. Unlike the Intel 4040, the \u03bcPD751 has separate data and address buses. A number of peripheral integrated circuits were provided for the \u03bcPD751:\n\n \u03bcPD752 - 8-bit I\/O port\n \u03bcPD757 - Keyboard and display controller\n \u03bcPD758 - Printer controller\n\n\u03bcCOM-41 \nThe \u03bcCOM-41 (\u03bcPD541) is a PMOS microprocessor in a 42-pin package. The following peripheral integrated circuits were available:\n\n \u03bcPD542 - ROM plus RAM\n \u03bcPD543 - ROM plus I\/O port\n\n\u03bcCOM-42 \nThe \u03bcCOM-42 (\u03bcPD548) is a 4-bit PMOS microcontroller in a 42-pin package. It has built-in ROM (1920 \u00d7 10 bit) and RAM (96 \u00d7 4 bit) as well as keyboard, display, and printer controllers. The \u03bcPD548 requires a power supply of -10V and the outputs can switch up to -35V. A ROM-less chip (\u03bcPD555) in a 64-pin quad-in-line package was available for hardware and software development.\n\n\u03bcCOM-43 through \u03bcCOM-46 \nThe \u03bcCOM-43 series consists of more than 10 different 4-bit microcontrollers. Broadly speaking, there are PMOS devices (\u03bcPD500 series), NMOS devices (\u03bcPD1500 series, \u03bcCOM-43N ), and CMOS devices (\u03bcPD650 series, \u03bcCOM-43C ). The \u03bcCOM-43, \u03bcCOM-44, \u03bcCOM-45, and \u03bcCOM-46 have the same basic instruction set. They differ in the amount of ROM and RAM, the number of I\/O pins, and the package (28-pin or 42-pin).  A ROM-less chip (\u03bcPD556) in a 64-pin quad-in-line package was available for hardware and software development. Beginning in 1980, they there were gradually replaced by the \u03bcCOM-75 series (see below).\n\n\u03bcCOM-47 \nThe \u03bcCOM-47 (\u03bcPD766) is a 4-bit NMOS microcontroller in a 64-pin package. It has built-in ROM and RAM as well as keyboard, display, and printer controllers.\n\n\u03bcCOM-75 \nThe \u03bcCOM-75 series consists of 4-bit microcontrollers. Only the first device in the series, the \u03bcPD7520, was still developed in PMOS technology.  All subsequent microcontrollers in the series (\u03bcPD7502 etc.) used CMOS. A ROM-less chip (\u03bcPD7500) in a 64-pin quad-in-line package was available for hardware and software development. By 1982 the \u03bcCOM-75 series was referred to as the \u03bcPD7500 series and later replaced by the 75X and 75XL series.\n\n\u03bcCOM-8 series\n\n\u03bcCOM-8 \nThe \u03bcCOM-8 (\u03bcPD753) is an 8-bit microprocessor that is software-compatible with the Intel 8080, but differs in its 42-pin package and its completely different pin-out. There are minor software differences as well, e.g. the setting of flags for the SUB instruction.\n\n\u03bcCOM-80 \nThe \u03bcCOM-80 (\u03bcPD8080A) is an 8-bit microprocessor that is pin-compatible with the Intel 8080 and software-compatible with the \u03bcCOM-8. That is, the \u03bcPD8080A has some improvements compared to the Intel 8080:\n BCD arithmetic is supported for both addition and subtraction (Intel 8080: addition only). Similar to the N flag in the Zilog Z80, the \u03bcPD8080A has a SUB flag (bit 5 of the flag register) to indicate that a subtraction was performed.\n The  instruction requires 4 clock cycles (Intel 8080: 5 clock cycles).\n 3-byte instructions are allowed in an interrupt acknowledge cycle, so a  instruction to any memory address can be used (Intel 8080: only 1-byte  instructions are allowed).\nUnfortunately, these improvements cause some programs written for the Intel 8080 not to run correctly. To overcome this problem, NEC introduced the \u03bcCOM-80F (\u03bcPD8080AF) which is completely compatible with the Intel 8080 in all details. The 1979 catalog no longer listed the improved \u03bcPD8080A. With the TK-80, NEC offered a development board for \u03bcCOM-80, which due to its low price became popular with hobbyists.\n\n\u03bcCOM-82 \nThe \u03bcCOM-82 (\u03bcPD780) is an 8-bit microprocessor compatible with the Zilog Z80. The \u03bcPD780C corresponds to the original Z80 (max. 2.5\u00a0MHz clock), while the \u03bcPD780C-1 corresponds to the Z80A (max. 4\u00a0MHz clock) and the \u03bcPD780C-2 to the Z80B (max. 6\u00a0MHz clock). The \u00b5PD780C-1 was used in Sinclair's ZX80, ZX81 and early versions of the ZX Spectrum, in several MSX and NEC (PC-6000, PC-8000, PC-8800) computers, in musical synthesizers such as Oberheim OB-8, and in Sega's SG-1000 game console.\n\nA CMOS version (\u03bcPD70008) followed later.\n\n\u03bcCOM-84 \nThe \u00b5COM-84 (\u00b5PD8048 etc.) is compatible with Intel's 8-bit microcontroller 8048.  CMOS microcontrollers up to \u03bcPD80C50 followed, but an Intel 8051 compatible product, which is the 8-bit industry standard, was never offered.\n\n\u03bcCOM-85 \nThe \u00b5COM-85 (\u00b5PD8085) is an Intel 8085 compatible 8-bit microprocessor.\n\n\u03bcCOM-86, \u03bcCOM-88 \nThe \u00b5COM-86 (\u00b5PD8086) and \u00b5COM-88 (\u00b5PD8088) are Intel 8086 and Intel 8088 compatible 16-bit microprocessors. They were superseded by the V series.\n\n\u03bcCOM-87, \u03bcCOM-87AD \nThe \u00b5COM-87 (\u00b5PD7800 etc.)  and \u00b5COM-87AD (\u00b5PD7810 etc.) are NEC original 8-bit microcontrollers. The \u03bcCOM-87AD adds an A\/D converter to the \u03bcCOM-87. The register configuration consists of two sets of 8 registers each (A, V, B, C, D, E, H, L). The V register is a vector register that stores the upper 8 bits of the address of the working memory area, and the short address space which is fixed in the current 78K series can be freely arranged. The \u03bcPD7805 and \u03bcPD7806 have only one set of 7 registers (no V register).  In the \u00b5PD7807 and later, the ALU is expanded to 16 bit and an EA register is added for 16-bit operation.  \n\nThe series came in 64-pin quad in-line package. This series was superseded by the 78K series.\n\n\u03bcCOM-16 series\n\n\u03bcCOM-16 \nThe \u03bcCOM-16 is a NEC original 16-bit microprocessor, implemented in two chips, the \u03bcPD755 (register + ALU) and \u03bcPD756 (controller), in 1974.\n\n\u03bcCOM-1600 \nThe \u03bcCOM-1600 (\u03bcPD768) is a NEC original single-chip 16-bit microprocessor that was announced in 1978.\n\nThe processor has 93 basic instructions, consisting of 1 to 3 16-bit words. The memory space of 1 Mbyte (512K words) is byte-addressable. The I\/O address space is 2048 bytes. There are 14 general-purpose registers. The processor has a 2-input vector interrupt, DMA control, refresh control for DRAM, and a master\/slave mode to enable multiprocessor operation.\n\nReferences \n\nmuCOM series"}

{"eng_Latn":"Simexco and Simex were the names of two black market trading companies that were created in 1940 and 1941, respectively in Brussels and Paris on the orders of Red Army Intelligence officer Leopold Trepper, for the express purpose of acting as cover for a Soviet espionage group that operated in Europe, and was later called the Red Orchestra (\"Rote Kapelle\") by the Abwehr.\n\nSimexco\n\nIn the autumn of 1940, the Simexco firm was established by GRU officer Anatoly Gurevich and Belgian businessman Nazarin Drailly, who was the firm's main shareholder. The firm was officially registered by March 1941, when it opened in two offices at 192 Rue Royale in Brussels. Simexco was established as a replacement cover organisation when the Brussels rain-ware export company known as the Foreign Excellent Raincoat Company was sequestered on 17 May 1940 after the occupation of Brussels, as its owner L\u00e9on Grossvogel was Jewish.\n\nSimexco was established as a genuine business with an absolutely firm legal status that was recognised as conservative in its approach by German service departments. On the recommendation of the administrative staff at the Abwehr IIIF. Ast. military command, it was granted long distance, telegram communication, telephone and fax facilities by the German authorities that provided a regular and privileged way for Trepper and Gurevich to communicate.\n\nGurevich became a director of the business. According to the article of incorporation, the main investor was Nazarine Drailly, a Belgian communist and informer, who invested 218,500 Belgian Francs in the firm. Drailly was fully aware of the companies true purpose and actively took part in operations. Drailly's brother, Charles Drailly, a banker, became a commercial director of the firm in March 1941. He was almost certainly aware of the nature of the firm, but maintained his distance in his role as a director, never taking part in espionage operations.\n\nMargarete (or Marguerite) Barcza, the daughter of a Czech millionaire, who lived with Gurevich, helped to find additional shareholders among her bridge club. These shareholders were Florida nightclub owner, Robert Christen, travelling salesman Jean Passelecq, the publisher Henri de Ryck, who was a friend of Gurevich and Henri Seghers, the owner of a cigarette factory.\n\nSimex\n\nIn autumn 1940, Simex opened its office, in two rooms above the Le Lido next to 78 Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris, and opposite the offices of Organisation Todt, the German military engineering organisation, who would become its best customer. It took almost a year of work, starting in the autumn of 1940 for L\u00e9on Grossvogel and Hillel Katz to register the business with the Paris Commercial Court on 26 September 1940. Its name was a metonym for S for Societe, IM for Import, EX for Export. It was established to be a large company offering civil and military engineering contract services, general dealership and materials for Nazi German contracts resulting from the occupation.  Trepper who used the alias Monsieur Gilbert in his dealings with the firm and several members of staff  used the company to obtain special permits that allowed them to cross demarcation lines to observe the progress of construction.\n\nThe funding used to create the company was monies salvaged by Jules Jaspar from the rain-ware company in Belgium, along with additional funds that were provided by the Soviet intelligence. This resulted in a financial capitalisation for Simex to the tune 300,000 French franc. Although Trepper became one of the main directors and general manager of the firm, using the alias Monsieur Jean Gilbert when dealing with any of the employees, he was not a shareholder. The businessman, L\u00e9on Grossvogel was the main shareholder and Robert Breyer, a friend of Grossvogel who was the other shareholder. The office personnel of Simex consisted of seven people, of which only three were aware of the real nature of the business. These were Trepper as Gilbert, Polish communist Hillel Katz, Gilbert's main assistant and French communist Suzanne Cointe, Gilbert's private secretary. Katz was Trepper's assistant and had known his since they were both in Palestine. In the day-to-day operations of the business, both Trepper in the role of Monsieur Gilbert and Grossvogel, an industrialist who does business always on the go, are ignored by office staff. The most important of the permanent staff was Suzanne Cointe, who was considered by Trepper to be our man at Simex. However, Trepper, who spent lavishly to establish a front that also included bribery of German officers. Trepper kept accurate note of spending, that had to be accounted for by Soviet intelligence.\n\nIn December 1941, Jaspar left to run the Simex branch on the Rue Dragon in Marseille, French commercial director Alfred Corbin took over. Corbin, an experienced businessman, had been recruited by Katz. Both Corbin and Jaspar were unaware of the espionage nature of Simex. On 20 November 1941, when Jaspar was arrested, he stated he thought he was working for British intelligence.\n\nIn February 1942, the company moved to 3rd floor offices at 89 Boulevard Haussmann at the insistence of Alfred Corbin, who believed their current location was rife with thieves.\n\nExpenses\nBoth the Simex and Simexco companies flourished and made substantial profits in return. In 1941, the net profits of both Simex and Simexco reached 1,616,000 Francs and in 1942, 1,614,000, after the costs of running the network were deducted. Trepper kept strict accounts as he had to submit them to Moscow for audit. His group were paid in Dollars, the traditional currency used by Moscow for their agents. In 1939, Trepper received 350 dollars a month, but this was cut to 275 dollars a month, when his wife and children were to Russia. His agents, Makarov, Gurevich and Grossvogel each initially received 175 dollars a month, before it also upped to 275 dollars. Trepper also had to account for monies spent in each location where there was an espionage network. From 1 June to 31 December, Trepper spent 5650 dollars in Brussels and 9421 dollars in Paris. These were only for daily expenses. Trepper used the money earned from Simex and Simexco to spend lavishly. This spend included bribes and money spent for the upkeep of the Ch\u00e2teau de Billeron and large daily expenses to maintain the veneer of a successful businessman. Trepper kept the accounts locked in a large clock in house at Verviers. To insure against financial ruin, he kept a special reserve of monies in the form of 1000 gold dollars in jars at a house of a trusted agent.\n\nDiscovery and arrest\nOn 13 December 1941, the German radio counterintelligence organisation, Funkabwehr, discovered the safehouse apartment at 101 Rue des Atr\u00e9bates in Brussels, that led to the arrest and among others of Gurevich's radio operator, Red Army Lieutenant Anton Danilov. Gurevich himself hid in the house of Nazarin Drailly to evade the Gestapo, while he made arrangements to transfer ownership of the organisation to Drailly, before leaving for Paris in the same month. When he left, Drailly took over management of the firm. On the 19 November 1942, the offices of Simexco was raided by the Gestapo after several months of surveillance. The Simex office in Paris was raided in the same day. When the Gestapo entered the Simexco office they found only one person, a clerk, but managed to discover all the names and addresses of Simexco employees and shareholders from company records.\n\nOver the month of November, most of the people associated with company were arrested and taken to St Gilles Prison in Brussels or Fort Breendonk in Mechelen. Some people managed to avoid early capture, like Nazarin Drailly, but he was eventually captured on 6 January 1943. His daughter, Solange Eva Drailly (born 1 February 1926), was also arrested, but released due to lack of evidence. Drailly was tortured with dogs that ripped his legs to shreds and they had to be amputated. The prisoners in St. Gilles were sent to Berlin by train, and taken to Gestapo HQ at Mauthausen concentration camp for further interrogation, before execution in Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison. The Nazi German tradition of Sippenhaft, meant than many family members of the accused were executed.\n\nReferences\n\nRed Orchestra (espionage)\nDefunct companies of Belgium\nDefunct companies of France"}

It stars Nicolas Fontaine, Brittany Drisdelle, Madelline Harvey, Lanisa Dawn, Paul Zinno, Nick Walker, and Chip Chuipka. The film is set at a water park, where a killer targets a group of recent high school graduates who are in competition for a cash prize for the fastest team to slide down the park's water slides.\n\nPlot\nOne night at the Wet Valley Water Park, two teenagers are killed by a machete wielding assailant while having sex.\n\nSome time later, the 2018 graduating class of Valley Hills High visits the water park, owned and supervised by Paul Wilkinson, for a weekend-long celebration of their graduation. Among those present are Josh, a member of a band called the Blades; Josh's bandmates Chad and Slim; Priscilla, Paul's wife; Alice, a graduate with whom Paul is cheating on Priscilla; Tommy, one of the park's employees; Conrad, an elderly pool cleaner; and Kimberly, who is Tommy's girlfriend and Josh's ex-girlfriend. Rumours circulate amongst the students about Priscilla supposedly choosing one graduate to have sex with each year.\n\nTwo drunk graduates go down one of the park's water slides, and are injured when one impacts with a glass bottle held by the other. They leave in an ambulance, and Paul orders Conrad to clean the pool without draining it. That night, Priscilla joins Josh's father, a real estate developer named Michael, in a restaurant for dinner. Josh and Kimberly have sex in the showers, and are secretly recorded on video by another graduate named Phil. Later, the Blades perform a song in the park. During their performance, the video of Josh and Kimberly having sex is sent to the other graduates, including Tommy, who punches Josh and is fired from the park.\n\nShortly thereafter, Michael tells Josh that he is negotiating ownership of the park with Paul. Elsewhere, an unseen individual installs a pair of large, metal blades, arranged in an \"X\" shape, in one of the park's water slides. The next day, Michael is fatally shot by an unseen attacker, and a boy uncovers a portable music player in a sandy area of the park. Later that day, an annual competition begins: teams of three members are to race down one of three slides, and whichever team reaches the pool below fastest wins a cash prize. Tommy worries that one of the slides will collapse, but his concerns are ignored.\n\nThe first set of teams each go down one of the slides. Alice and two other graduates go down the slide containing the blades, and are cut to pieces. Tommy, while attempting to warn his fellow graduates not to go down the slides, is pushed down the weaponised slide; he becomes stuck against the blades and the bodies caught therein. The pool below begins to fill with blood and limbs from the weaponised slide, causing spectators to panic. Paul and Priscilla, unaware of the danger, continue to send teams down the slides, and eventually decide to slide down themselves. Josh unsuccessfully attempts to save Paul from sliding into the blades. Josh and Conrad both climb to the top of the slide to try to prevent other people from sliding down the slide, but are pushed down the slide.\n\nFollowing the massacre, a surviving Josh meets with a lawyer, who informs Josh that Michael left him his estate, and has him authorise the replacement of the Wet Valley Water Park with a shopping complex. It is then revealed that the individual who installed the blades in the slide and killed Michael was Priscilla, who, 35 years prior, witnessed her father die in the water park.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, the boy with the portable music player surfaces in the bloody pool.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\nAquaslash was filmed at the Super Aqua Club water park in Pointe-Calumet, Quebec, Canada.\n\nRelease\nAquaslash had its world premiere at the 2019 Fantasia Film Festival on July 29, 2019.\n\nThe film was distributed by Red Hound Films and released at drive-in theatres and on video on demand on June 23, 2020.\n\nReception\nCody Hamman of Arrow in the Head gave Aquaslash a score of seven out of ten, writing: \"Once people start going down the slide those blades are in, Aquaslash delivers a sequence of bloodshed and insanity that lasts for several minutes, and that sequence earns the movie a recommendation.\" Dread Centrals Josh Millican called the film an \"irreverent, retro slasher throwback from Canada. Unique in its build towards a singularly shocking sequence, Aquaslash is way more exciting than your typical trip to the water park\".\n\nRob Hunter of Film School Rejects gave Aquaslash a negative review, criticising its story and characters and calling it \"a barely watchable misfire [...] but it still finds some unintentional laughs in its serious nonsense.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n\n2019 films\n2010s slasher films\nCanadian slasher films\n2019 horror films\nEnglish-language Canadian films\nFilms set in water parks\nFilms shot in Quebec\n2010s English-language films\n2010s Canadian films"}

Published in 1996 by Chaosium, it conforms to the Basic Role-Playing rules system used by the 5th edition of Call of Cthulhu.\n\nReception\nIn the December 1996 edition of Arcane (Issue #14), Steve Faragher criticized the cover art as \"tacky\", but said the adventure waiting inside was \"a shiny little gem,\" praising the \"elegance of thought that has gone into its design [that] leads the players deeper and deeper into an intricate web of competition, paranoia, deceit and deadly evil \u2014 in other words, everything you could ever want from a game of Call of Cthulhu.\" Faragher's only complaint was \"that the writing style is a little complex which [...] can make the campaign a bit difficult to get a clear grip on, especially in the early stages. He concluded by giving the adventure an excellent rating of 9 out of 10, saying, \"Horror's Heart is a fine example of why Call of Cthulhu remains one of the most popular roleplaying games ever created.\"  \n\nIn the October 1997 edition of Dragon (Issue #240), Rick Swan thought that this book showcased \"all the elements that make Call of Cthulhu so electrifying.\" Swan called the plot \"compelling\", the locales \"eerie\", and the adversaries \"mind-boggling\". He also thought the \"well-staged encounters\" and a \"surplus of gamemastering tips\" made these scenarios \"a snap to run.\" Swan's only criticism was \"the limp finale, disappointing after such a provocative build-up,\" saying it \"prevents Horror\u2019s Heart from achieving classic status.\" He concluded by giving this adventure an excellent rating of 5 out of 6.\n\nOther reviews\nRollespilsmagasinet F\u00f8nix, Issue 15 (Feb 1997, p60, in Danish)\nPortal, Issue 7 (Oct 2000, p.144, in Polish)\n\nReferences\n\nCall of Cthulhu (role-playing game) adventures\nRole-playing game supplements introduced in 1996"}

It is best known for the fresco of a dog-headed Saint Christopher, something rare in Greece. Today it's a historical landmark. The inside of the church is closed to the public.\n\nLocation \nIt is located in Alepochori, Evros, Greece. It is about 130 meters from the southernmost plot, in the area of the cemetery, on a small hill. Today it functions only as a cemetery, while in the past it also functioned as a parish church of the village. There are 3 post-Byzantine historical churches in the local area. Along with the post-Byzantine church of Saint Athanasius in Alepochori, there is Saint Athanasius in Metaxades (1695) and Saint Pantaleon in Paliouri (~18th century).\n\nHistory \nIt was built in 1729 by the Greek Orthodox community in the village secretly during the Ottoman era. Most of the church was built under the ground as a result of fear not to provoke the Ottomans, as the Greek community often fell victim to janissaries and delibasis who looted area of Thrace. It was used as a \"secret school\" during the Ottoman era, so the Greek alphabet and the Orthodox faith was learned to the minors.\n\nIt was designated as a historical monument in 1953. The old church operated till 1952, when a new church was built for the village.\n\nDesign \nIt is made of limestone (the local stone from Metaxades), it is single-aisled and without Columns. Quite low and part of it in the ground. It has two entrances: one on the north side, while the main entrance is on the west side. The west side door was for women and the north door was for men.\n\nIt is built without windows, on which a wooden tiled roof is based, four-pitched, with a perimeter overhang of about 0.35m wide. The soil in the immediate vicinity of the church is covered with vegetation. According to the literature, the church was built in one phase, while its wall paintings dates back to 1729, according to a founding inscription, which is saved intact above the northern entrance of the main church (inside). Internally the church is divided, with by a plastered wooden partition, in a narthex and main part of church, which is separated from the sanctuary by a wooden iconostasis with two gates. \n\nThere are two entrances, with wooden double doors, one in the narthex on the west side and one in the main part of the church on the north side. The sanctuary ends in the semicircular apse with a hemispherical dome. In the north and the south wall of the sanctuary is formed by a niche with arch. In the dome of the apse there is an opening with a sloping upward direction, blind (with closed end), which served in the past, probably, the ventilation of the sanctuary. The wooden iconostasis is decorated with embossed elements, partially gilded and with written plant and geometric depictions. According to the literature, this is the original iconostasis of the church. In front of the iconostasis there are two stone carved Candlesticks. The floor of the building is paved with large, irregular slate slabs, joined with cement mortar.\n\nRare representation of Saint Christopher \n\nThe most characteristic thing about the monument that stands out is the mural, that of Saint Christopher which is presented with an animal-shaped head. Saint Christopher is sometimes represented as a Cynocephalus, with the head of a dog. There are only a very few in Greece. It is depicted with a long and sharp muzzle, a long mane on the neck and small sharp ears. Always in a standing position, in one hand he holds a rod and in the other the cross of Martyrdom. A similar representation of the Saint is exhibited in the Byzantine and Christian Museum of Athens.\n\nOld tombstones \nAround the church there are burials with interesting tombstones from the 18th century, but also newer to modern. The old tombstones come from the Christian inhabitants during the occupation of the Ottoman Empire and the Bulgarians after.\n\nPhotos\n\nReferences \n\nDidymoteicho\nBuildings and structures in Evros (regional unit)\nChurches completed in 1729\n18th-century churches in Greece\nEastern Orthodox church buildings in Greece\n18th-century Eastern Orthodox church buildings"}

{"eng_Latn":"Between April 23\u201330, 1961, a tornado outbreak sequence struck the Midwest, Ohio, and Mississippi Valleys, and the Eastern United States. Large hailstorms accompanied the tornadoes as well and numerous other weather events also occurred. Three people were killed, 38 others were injured and losses totaled $26.810 million (1961 USD). Two additional fatalities also occurred due to flooding and lightning.\n\nMeteorological synopsis\nA series of at least two or three disturbances moved over the US over the timespan of nine days, starting with a strong weather system that came out of the Rocky Mountains on April 22. On April 23, multiple cells impacted the Midwest, with several strong, long-tracked tornadoes being reported, producing several casualties. On April 24, multiple clusters of severe thunderstorms formed over Oklahoma as well as South-Central and Southeastern Kansas. These storms produced multiple reports of wind and hail damage, power outages, funnel clouds, and a tornado. The storms congealed into a squall line that produced additional severe weather and tornadoes along with flash flooding through Missouri into West Virginia overnight into April 25. Following the squall line, a massive cluster of severe and tornadic thunderstorms with torrential downpours formed over Indiana and Tennessee and trekked eastward, producing massive amounts of damage and numerous casualties. General thunderstorms produced scattered activity during April 26-29 before another outbreak surged through the Great Plains on April 30, the final day of the sequence.\n\nConfirmed tornadoes\n\nApril\u00a023 event\n\nApril\u00a024 event\n\nApril\u00a025 event\n\nApril\u00a026 event\n\nApril\u00a027 event\n\nApril\u00a028 event\n\nApril\u00a029 event\n\nApril\u00a030 event\n\nMarshalltown\u2013Vinton\u2013Center Point\u2013Monticello, Iowa\n\nThis large, strong, long-tracked F3 tornado\u2013which was most likely a tornado family\u2013first touched down in Southern Marshalltown and immediately became strong, damaging numerous structures. The damage to the town alone was estimated at $1 million and eyewitnesses reported that tornado had more than one funnel as it passed through town. From there the tornado moved generally eastward at up to  on a discontinuous path that may have included more than one tornado. It first passed south of Garwin before crossing the Hinkle Creek directly into Garrison. It then struck the south side of Vinton before moving directly through Center Point and Alice. After crossing the Wapsipinicon River and striking the north side of Central City, it crossed Buffalo Creek, striking areas south of Prairiesburg. It was observed with a double funnel again as it passed by Monticello, one of four times this was reported during the tornado's lifespan. The tornado dissipated shortly after that.\n\nThe tornado traveled , had a maximum width of , and caused $5 million in damage. One person was killed and 12 others were injured. The tornado was also notable because it was embedded within a massive swath of wind and hail damage that was  wide. Wind gust of up to  were recorded along with hail up to  in diameter. Northwest Jones County saw an excessive amount of hail with up to  drifts in some areas.\n\nLorenzo\u2013Peotone, Illinois\/Belshaw\u2013Roselawn, Indiana\n\nThis strong, destructive, long-tracked F3 tornado (which was also likely a tornado family) accompanied by a vicious hailstorm first touched down over Lorenzo, Illinois. It proceeded east-southeastward, immediately becoming strong and destroying seven homes in the town. It then crossed the Kankakee River and passed north of Wilmington, toppling a trailer truck. Passing north of Symerton and south of Wilton Center, the tornado continued to damage numerous homes and farmsteads as it moved through open country, before plowing into Peotone. 600 homes were damaged by both the tornado and the massive hail that fell with it. One hailstone was reportedly  in diameter, although this was never verified. The Peotone Airport was hit hard as 21 planes were damaged by hail alone, with most being completely totaled beyond repair. All four injuries from the tornado occurred in Peotone when a house trailer was rolled. The tornado then weakened and may have briefly lifted as it passed halfway between Beecher and Polk before abruptly turning southeastward as it entered Indiana on a non-continuous damage path. Throughout Illinois, the tornado injured four and caused $2.5 million in damage.\n\nAs the tornado touched downed again in Indiana, more large hail began to fall. The tornado passed west of North Hayden located west of Lowell, Indiana before causing the heaviest damage in the state near Belshaw at the intersection of US 41 and SR 2. Here the tornado damaged multiple farm buildings and toppled 30 billboards along US 41. Hail up to  in diameter and a depth of up to an  fell in here and in the nearby town of Schneider, where the hail damage to roofs and windows was the most extensive. The tornado then passed west of Shelby and Thayer before dissipating just outside of Roselawn. The tornado did F2 damage at its peak in Indiana with losses totaling $250,000.\n\nThe tornado traveled , was  wide, and caused $2.75 million in damage. There were four injuries.\n\nMarion\u2013Waterloo\u2013Boston, Indiana\/Eaton, Ohio\n\nFour funnel clouds consolidated into this long-tracked, violent, skipping multi-vortex F4 tornado\u2013which may have been tornado family of at least two tornadoes. It first touched down in Shelby County, Indiana northwest of Shelbyville along I-74 and immediately became violent, tossing a loaded truck . It then proceeded east-northeastward at , heavily damaging Marion and Knighthood Village. A total of 10 homes and 21 barns were destroyed, and 11 other homes were badly damaged. One person was injured and losses totaled $2.5 million in the area.\n\nThe tornado then continued into rural areas of Rush County, where 15 homes were badly damaged. North of Rushville, multiple trucks were rolled or flipped, injuring three. Homes and buildings south of the town of Gings were also badly damaged and losses in the county reached $2.5 million.\n\nIn Fayette County, the tornado moved through mostly rural areas before passing through the three-town trio of Harrisburg, Huber and Waterloo. Waterloo was the hardest hit as multiple homes and buildings were destroyed. Three homes and two mobile homes were obliterated throughout the county before the tornado clipped the northwest side of Union County, passing south of Philomath and Abington. Damage in both counties reached $2.5 million.\n\nSome of the most extreme damage occurred as the tornado entered Wayne County and struck the town of Boston. Two homes and a mobile home were obliterated and three people in one of the homes were injured, one seriously. Heavy damage occurred along the roads heading in and out of town before the tornado moved into Ohio. Losses in Wayne County reached $2.5 million.\n\nThe tornado then turned almost due east as it moved into rural Preble County, Ohio.

It first struck the town of West Florence, heavily damaging or partially destroying multiple farmhouses and barns. As the tornado entered the west side of Eaton, another farmhouse was obliterated and swept away, although a ring of trees around the home were incredibly left undamaged. A nearby barn was also obliterated and an adjacent housing development of brand new homes was badly damaged. The tornado then weakened, but remained strong as it entered Eaton, damaging a grove of trees as well as the roof of an office buildings and stores. The tornado then weakened further as it continued through the central part of Eaton, causing only light to minor damage to treetops and roofs and breaking windows before finally dissipating on the east side of town. Damage in Ohio reached $2.5 million.\n\nThe tornado was on the ground for at least 89 minutes, traveled , and was  (one source says ) wide. Seven people were injured and losses totaled $12.5 million in damage.\n\nNon-tornadic impacts\nNumerous reports of strong winds and large hail were recorded throughout the event.

Throughout the event there were 11 reports of hail over  in diameter and nine report of wind gusts over .\n\nFlash flooding was also a major issue throughout the event and one man did drown after being caught flood waters caused by Adens Creek in Ohio. Heavy rainfall also caused flash flooding and numerous accidents in Southeastern Kansas on April 30, injuring one.\n\nLightning was a surprisingly destructive and deadly catalyst during the event. Overnight during April 24-25, multiple lightning strikes across Southern Michigan triggered several fires that seriously damaged homes, destroyed a barn, and caused power outages in both Ann Arbor and Flint. In an extreme case on April 26, static electricity caused by intense lightning strikes caused a premature explosion of a 5-lb. charge of dynamite in a water tunnel that was under construction in Northboro, Massachusetts. One person was killed and 11 others were injured, three seriously, with one man losing his arm.\n\nIn Northeastern Montana, rain turned to snow, and high winds from the evening of April 22 into April 23. An all-day blizzard also occurred in Western and Southern North Dakota on April 23, with snow totals reaching as high as . Since it was heavy, wet snow, it froze up on power lines overnight, leading to widespread power outages.\n\nHigh winds on the back side of the first system on April 23 caused heavy damage to crops in Southeastern Wyoming, Northwestern Nebraska, and Northeastern Colorado. Greeley, Colorado was especially hard hit as a factory lost approximately 600 acres of sugar beets.\n\nSee also\n List of North American tornadoes and tornado outbreaks\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n04-23\nF4 tornadoes\n04-23 Tornado Outbreak Sequence\n04-23 Tornado Outbreak Sequence\n04-23 Tornado Outbreak Sequence\n04-23 Tornado Outbreak Sequence\n04-23 Tornado Outbreak Sequence\n04-23 Tornado Outbreak Sequence\n04-23 Tornado Outbreak Sequence\n04-23 Tornado Outbreak Sequence\n04-23 Tornado Outbreak Sequence\n04-23 Tornado Outbreak Sequence\n04-23 Tornado Outbreak Sequence\nTornadoes in Oklahoma\nTornadoes in Ohio\nTornadoes in Texas\nTornadoes in Kansas\nTornadoes in Connecticut\nTornadoes in Iowa\nTornadoes in Illinois\nTornadoes in Indiana\nTornadoes in Kentucky\nTornadoes in Missouri\nTornadoes in Delaware"}

He began taking interest in basketball at age 14, even though his father initially wanted him to focus on his education instead. Due to the lack of facilities, he ran on the beach and did push-ups to train, impressing his father. At age 15, Ngom moved away from his family to play for the youth program of Unicaja M\u00e1laga in Spain. While in Spain, he was discovered by his fellow countryman Boniface N'Dong who put Ngom in contact with Holger Geschwindner, the mentor of Dirk Nowitzki. Ngom spent two years in Germany: In the 2015-16 season, he played in the Bamberg youth set up. In 2016-17, he had a double license to compete for the N\u00fcrnberg Falcons U19 team and the Longhorns Herzogenaurach men's team, competing in the country's fourth-tier division Regionalliga. While in Germany, he worked out with Geschwindner.\n\nIn 2017, Ryerson head coach Roy Rana saw Ngom at the SEED Project's Hoop Forum in Dakar, an event featuring top high school players in Senegal.

{"eng_Latn":"Andes Iron is a Chilean exploration and mining company with two major projects in Chile. The Dominga project is a proposed open-pit copper mine with accompanying processing plant, desalination plant, slurry pipelines and an export port.\n\nHistory\n\nPlanning \nMiner\u00eda Activa Uno Spa began investing in the prospecting phase for new mines in 2008. Mediterr\u00e1neo Fondo de Inversi\u00f3n (FIP), the largest investor of Miner\u00eda Activa Uno Spa, agreed with establishing a mine at the Santa Dominga Norte y Sur area in the town of La Higuera.\n\nIn 2009, Chilean businessman, presidential candidate and soon-to-be president of Chile Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era began to invest in Andes Iron through Mediterr\u00e1neo Fondo de Inversi\u00f3n (FIP) according to Radio B\u00edo-B\u00edo.\n\nThe project was quickly challenged by environmentalists, including the marine conservation organisation Oceana, for its potential to impact the Humboldt Penguin National Reserve and the wider marine ecology of the area, which they describe as a marine biodiversity hotspot. The project's environmental license was rejected in 2017.\n\nApproval \nThe government of President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, who was elected for a second non-consecutive term, successfully appealed the rejection of Dominga's environmental license and the company was expected to start work on the Dominga project by 2020. The company stated that it would be prepared to concede its proposed port at Totoralillo, Coquimbo if Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera del Pac\u00edfico, a subsidiary of Chilean iron producer CAP, was permitted to construct their proposed Cruz Grande port nearby.\n\nPandora Papers \nIn the Pandora Papers leak of 3 October 2021, President Pi\u00f1era was named in the revealed documents. According to Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, Chilean media organizations CIPER and LaBot allegedly documented that Pi\u00f1era was involved in \"particularly controversial activity\". The Pandora leak reported that Pi\u00f1era sold Minera Dominga to his friend since childhood, Carlos Alberto D\u00e9lano, shortly after entering the presidency in 2010. It was reported that a small transaction was first made in Chile while two subsequently larger payments were made in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nIn response to the leak, Pi\u00f1era's business manager said that Pi\u00f1era had not been in control of his own companies for about twelve years and that he was not aware of the sale of Minera Dominga to his friend Carlos Alberto D\u00e9lano.\n\nOwnership \nThe company's other project, Iman, is a prospective iron ore mine. It is owned in a 50-50 partnership with Miner\u00eda Activa. Andes Iron is majority owned by the Delano Mendez family (74%), with minor interests held by the Garcez Silva family (14%), and the company's directors (11%).\n\nReferences \n\nMining companies of Chile\nPandora Papers"}

In the hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch, it appears as EG 510, with a 1928 melody by Frieda Fronm\u00fcller.\n\nHistory \nThe text was written by Philipp Spitta, a Lutheran theologian from Lower Saxony, in 1827, when he worked as young private teacher in L\u00fcne near L\u00fcneburg. It describes the beauty of nature as God's creation, comparing it to precious artwork. He wrote five stanzas of four lines each, with the last line repeated.\n\nThe text first appeared without a melody in Spitta's song collection Psalter und Harfe (Psalter and harp), subtitled Sammlung christlicher Lieder zur h\u00e4uslichen Erbauung (Collection of Christian songs for edification at home). The hymn was titled \"Die Sch\u00f6nheit der Natur\" (The beauty of nature). Several melodies were tried. In 1928, Frieda Fronm\u00fcller composed a new melody which was successful with choirs, and was chosen for inclusion in the modern German Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch as EG 510. The hymn also appears in many songbooks.\n\nText \nThe text as in the Protestant hymnal is:\n\nThe song has been compared to Paul Gerhardt's \"Geh aus, mein Herz, und suche Freud\". Both appeared after wars, Spitta's after the Napoleonic Wars, and both reflect the beauty of nature as God's creation.

{"eng_Latn":"Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7 or Global Goal 7) is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. It aims to \"Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.\" Access to energy is an important pillar for the wellbeing of the people as well as for economic development and poverty alleviation.\n\nThe goal has five targets to be achieved by 2030. Progress towards the targets is measured by six indicators. Three out of the five targets are outcome targets: Universal access to modern energy; increase global percentage of renewable energy; double the improvement in energy efficiency. The remaining two targets are means of implementation targets: to promote access to research, technology and investments in clean energy; and expand and upgrade energy services for developing countries. In other words, these targets include access to affordable and reliable energy while increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. They also focus on improving energy efficiency, international cooperation and investment in clean energy infrastructure.\n\nAccording to a review report in 2019, some progress towards achieving SDG 7 is being made, but many of the targets of SDG 7 will not be met. SDG 7 and SDG 13 (climate action) are closely related.\n\nProblem description \n\nSDG 7 is tackling the problem of the high number of people globally who live without access to electricity or clean cooking solutions (0.8 billion and 2.4 billion people, respectively, in 2020). Energy is needed for many activities, for example jobs and transport, food security, health and education.\n\nPeople that are hard to reach with electricity and clean cooking solutions include those who live in remote areas or are internally displaced people, or those who live in urban slums or marginalized communities.\n\nTargets, indicators and progress\n\nSDG 7 has five targets, measured with five indicators, which are to be achieved by 2030. Three out of the five targets are \"outcome targets\", and two are \"means of achieving targets\".\n\nTarget 7.1: Universal access to modern energy \nThe first target of SDG 7 is Target 7.1: \"By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services\".\n\nThis target has two indicators:\n\n Indicator 7.1.1: Proportion of population with access to electricity\n Indicator 7.1.2: Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology. \n\nA report from 2019 found that India, Bangladesh, and Kenya had made good progress with supplying more of their people with electricity. Globally, there are now (2020) 800 million people still without electricity, compared with 1.2 billion people in 2010.\n\nThere are several options to tackle this problem, for example private sector financing and ensuring that rural areas get access to electricity. This may involve decentralized renewable energy.\n\nWomen are disproportionately affected by indoor air pollution caused by the use of fuels such as coal and wood indoors. Reasons for not changing over to clean cooking solutions can include higher fuel costs and the need to change cooking processes.\n\nTarget 7.2: Increase global percentage of renewable energy \n\nThe second target of SDG 7 is Target 7.2: \"By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.\"\n\nIt has only one indicator: Indicator 7.2.1 is the \"Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption\". \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nData from 2016 showed that the share of renewable energy compared to total energy consumption was 17.5%.\n\nTarget 7.3: Double the improvement in energy efficiency \n\nThe third target of SDG 7 is Target 7.3: \"By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency\".\n\nIt has one indicator: Indicator 7.3.1 is the \"Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP\". \u00a0\n\nIn general, energy efficiency has been going up in recent years, in particular in China. Governments can help with this process for example by providing suitable financial incentives and by helping people access information about energy efficiency.\n\nTarget 7.a: Promote access to research, technology and investments in clean energy \n\nThe fourth target of SDG 7 is Target 7.a: \"By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology\".\n\nIt has one indicator: Indicator 7.4.1 is the \"International financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems\". \u00a0\n\nThere is twice the amount of international financing for renewable energy going to developing countries in 2017 compared to 2010. In 2017 most of this financing (nearly half) went to hydropower and nearly 20% to solar power projects.\n\nMore investments are needed for global energy access, namely for electrification and clean cooking: A report in 2021 state that \"the financing community is failing to deliver on SDG7\".\n\nTarget 7.b: Expand and upgrade energy services for developing countries \nThe fifth target of SDG 7 is formulated as: \"Target 7.b: By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programs of support.\"\n\nIt has one indicator: Indicator 7.5.1 is the \"Investments in energy efficiency as a proportion of GDP and the amount of foreign direct investment in financial transfer for infrastructure and technology to sustainable development services\".\n\nAs of August 2020, there is no data available for this indicator.\n\nIt was reported in 2020 that Indicator\u00a07.b.1 might be removed as it is identical with indicator 12.1.1 of SDG 12.\n\nCustodian agencies \nCustodian agencies are in charge of reporting on the following indicators:\n\n Indicators 7.1.1 and 7.1.2: World Bank (WB) and World Health Organization (WHO).\n Indicator 7.2.1: Department of Economic and Social Affairs-Statistics Division (DESA\/UNDP), International Energy Agency (IEA) and International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).\n Indicator 7.3.1 are Department of Economic and Social Affairs-Statistics Division (DESA\/UNDP) and International Energy Agency (IEA).\n Indicator 7.a.1: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).\n Indicator 7.b.1: International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nOverall progress and monitoring \nThe UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) meets every year for global monitoring of the SDGs, under the auspices of the United Nations economic and Social Council. High-level progress reports for all the SDGs are published by the United Nations Secretary General.\n\nIn 2022, the renewable energy- generating capacity in developing countries has increased by 58% in renewable capacity per capita. However, the international financial flows to developing countries to support renewable energy was 24% lower than in 2018. Despite having progress in 2019 to 2020, there has been recent global events such as the war in Ukraine has impacted global progress in renewable energy and decarbonization transition by having it at a halt or decreasing rather than increasing.\n\nDespite progress, the world is in 2022 not on track to achieve SDG 7. The progress towards SDG 7 has not been faster due to the world entering its third year of COVID-19 along with the highest number of violent conflicts and with the Russian invasion of Ukraine creating one of the largest refugee crises to happen. There are still over 700 million people without access to electricity and about 2.4 billion cooking with harmful fuels that also are polluting the environment. More efforts need to be exerted to improved use of renewable energy and energy efficiency faster. These events has had catastrophic effect the livelihoods of many people and though in 2021, as the global economy started to rebound, these chain of events and negative effects as caused the global economy and progress to SDG 7 and other SDGs to slow down.\n\nAccording to the 2020 SDG report, affordable and reliable energy is now needed more than ever, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, to supply hospitals and health facilities as well as access to energy for students learning remotely. Access to electricity has improved strongly in Asia and Latin America, so that an increasing share of people without access live in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is estimated that around 620 million people would still lack access to electricity if the world continues to move at the current pace by 2030.\n\nCountry Implementation\n\nCanada \nAs a signatory of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Government of Canada has committed to developing a national strategy for the 2030 Agenda, accelerating the progress of Sustainable Development Goals in Canada. This included nationwide public consultations that led to the release of the interim document Towards Canada's 2030 Agenda National Strategy, in which federal departments were mapped out against Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The subsequent release of the final document Moving forward Together: Canada's 2030 Agenda National Strategy, highlighting the societal actors involved, objectives for engagement and action, specific action items, and federals action on SDGs to date.\n\nFor Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, the Canadian federal departments involved in achieving this goal include Global Affairs Canada, Infrastructure Canada, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, Natural Resources Canada, and Public Services and Procurement Canada.\n\nSince the release of Towards Canada's 2030 Agenda National Strategy, the Canadian government has released multiple documents illustrating the targets, strategies, and procedures to accomplish and track the progress of SDGs by 2030.\n\nChallenges \n\nIn 2020, it was reported that many health facilities in developing countries (about 25%) still have no electricity at all or have frequent outages. This was particularly problematic during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the crisis progress has been seen in some aspect of SDG7 such as improvement in energy efficiency, use of renewable energy and increased access to electricity to people.\n\nLinks with other SDGs\nThe SDGs are all interlinked. Energy (or SDG 7) is key to most global issues: this includes poverty eradication (SDG 1), gender equality (SDG 5), climate action (SDG 13), food security (SDG 2), health (SDG 3), education (SDG 4), sustainable cities (SDG 11), jobs (SDG 8) and transport (SDG 9).\n\nSDG 7 and SDG 13 (climate action) are closely related.\n\nAccess to energy is directly related to human development. This is particularly true for women, who spend more of their time collecting fuel and water, and preparing meals. Access to energy would allow them to spend more time on education and work.\n\nAccording to UN Women, energy interventions that take into perspective women's needs have a significant impact on addressing gender equality and community energy poverty while also ensuring the equal participation of women in energy intervention that in turn benefits the society at large.\n\nOrganizations\n\nThere are five custodian agencies for SDG 7 which together published the 2020 Energy Progress Report: \n International Energy Agency (IEA)  \n International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)\nUnited Nations Statistics Division (UNSD)\n World Bank (WB) \n World Health Organization (WHO)\n\nSee also \n\n Sustainable Energy for All\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nSustainable Development Knowledge Platform (SDG 7) \nEnergypedia - collaborative knowledge exchange on various energy topics in developing countries\nUnderstanding SDG 7\n\u201cGlobal Goals\u201d Campaign - SDG 7\nSDG-Track.org - SDG 7\nUN SDG 7 in the US\n\nUnited Nations General Assembly\nRenewable energy policy\nSustainable Development Goals\nUnited Nations documents\nSustainable energy\n2015 establishments in New York City\nProjects established in 2015"}

{"eng_Latn":"The Bertelsmann Transformation Index (BTI) is a measure of the development status and governance of political and economic transformation processes in developing and transition countries around the world. The BTI has been published biennially by the Bertelsmann Stiftung since 2005, most recently in 2022 on 137 countries. The index measures and compares the quality of government action in a ranking list based on self-recorded data and analyzes successes and setbacks on the path to constitutional democracy and a market economy accompanied by sociopolitical support. For this purpose, the \"Status Index\" is calculated on the general level of development with regard to democratic and market-economy characteristics and the \"Management Index\" on the political management of decision-makers.\n\nStatus and Management Index \nThe Bertelsmann Transformation Index publishes two rankings. The Status Index is composed of the study dimensions Political and Economic Transformation. Political transformation includes essential features of a democratic state order. This includes participation rights, the rule of law, the stability of democratic institutions and the political and social integration of institutions, but also statehood as a basic condition for the functioning of a democracy. Economic transformation takes into account not only the classic market-economy characteristics such as economic performance, market and competition regulation, currency and price stability and the protection of private property, but also social components such as the level of socio-economic development, the social order and ecological and educational sustainability.\n\nThe Management Index assesses the extent to which political decision-makers can steer and promote the transformation process. It is composed of the criteria steering capability, resource efficiency, consensus building and international cooperation. In calculating the Management Index, the degree of difficulty is taken into account, such as structural obstacles, civil society traditions and the intensity of conflict.\n\nBertelsmann Transformation Indices by Country \nThe following list shows the Bertelsmann Transformation Indices since 2016.\n\nMethod of calculation \n\nThe Status and Management Index is composed of a modular system of investigation dimensions (2nd level), criteria (3rd level) and indicators (4th level).\n\nCountry selection \nAll developing and transition countries with more than one million inhabitants are examined. Developing and transition countries are those countries that are not considered to be democratically and market-economically consolidated. In the absence of a concretely applicable definition of the consolidation limit, OECD membership prior to 1989 is used as a consolidation criterion.\n\nIn exceptional cases, countries with less than one million inhabitants (Bhutan, Djibouti and Montenegro) are also examined. From 2003 to 2022, the number of countries surveyed has increased from 116 to 137.\n\nSurvey procedure \nThe reports and assessments of each study, involving some 250 country experts, are based on a multi-stage survey and review process. The aim of the procedure is to arrive at results that are as objective and comparable as possible. Two experts per country - usually one international and one local expert - prepare and review qualitative country analyses on the basis of 49 standardized questions and translate the answers independently of each other into quantitative assessments. On this basis, seven regional coordinators standardise the results intra- and interregionally. A scientific advisory board of transformation experts monitors and discusses the results and adopts the final values.\n\nThe prototype of the BTI was published in 2003 and subsequently methodologically revised. Since then, no fundamental methodological changes have taken place, so that comparable time series since 2006 can be formed.\n\nPublications \nThe study results are published in the form of country and regional reports and a book series in English and partly in German. Initiated and financed by foreign think tanks, BTI study content has also been published in other languages: in Arabic by the Gulf Research Center in 2009, in Russian by the Moscow Center for Post-Industrial Studies in 2010 and in Spanish by the Argentinean Centro para la Apertura y el Desarrollo de Am\u00e9rica Latina in 2014. The BTI Atlas, a graphics application, offers individual visual access to the results and reports of all editions since 2006.\n\nUse \nThe Bertelsmann Transformation Index is used both by governments around the world to assess partner countries and by international organizations to produce their own analyses. Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index and the Ibrahim Index of African Governance are based in part on BTI results.\n\nThe sister project Sustainable Governance Indicators, which is methodologically modelled on the BTI, examines the reform capacity and sustainability of advanced democracies and market economies. The study covers all OECD and EU member states, including the OECD core countries not included in the BTI.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Website\n\nSustainability metrics and indices\nEnvironmental policy\nSocial change\nSocial science indices"}

{"eng_Latn":"Johns Hopkins Children's Center (JHCC) is a nationally ranked, pediatric acute care children's teaching hospital located in Baltimore, Maryland, adjacent to Johns Hopkins Hospital. The hospital has 196 pediatric beds and is affiliated the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The hospital is the flagship pediatric member of Johns Hopkins Medicine and is 1 of 2 children's hospital in the network. The hospital provides comprehensive pediatric specialties and subspecialties to infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0\u201321 throughout Baltimore and the wider United States. Johns Hopkins Children's Center also sometimes treats adults that require pediatric care. Johns Hopkins Children's Center also features the only ACS verified Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center in the state. The hospital is directly attached to Johns Hopkins Hospital and is situated near the Ronald McDonald House of Maryland.\n\nHistory \nPediatrics at Johns Hopkins originated in 1912 when the original Harriet Lane Home for Invalid Children opened. The new hospital was set to be named after Baltimore resident, Harriet Lane Johnston after she donated $400,000 in 1903 to establish the home as a memorial to her two sons who had died in childhood. After a few years of building, the building opened in October 1912. Harriet Lane Home for Invalid Children was first children's clinic in the United States that was associated with a medical school.\n\nAt the time, most children were seen in the same facilities as adults and pediatrics was just a subspecialty of general medicine. The new care model that Johns Hopkins pioneered became the industry standard for pediatrics in the United States. Eventually treating over 60,000 children a year, the Harriet Lane Home became a pioneer treatment, teaching, and research clinic, and the first to have subspecialties in pediatrics as created by Edwards A. Park.\n\nFrom 1930 to 1963 Helen Taussig, who helped to develop the blue baby operation, headed the pediatric cardiac clinic. Child psychiatrist Leo Kanner did studies of autistic children. Lawson Wilkins established an endocrine clinic that developed procedures used universally to treat children with certain glandular disorders, including dwarfism. John E. Bordley and William G. Hardy made strides in detecting hearing impairments in very young children.\n\nIn 1964, the Children's Medical & Surgical Center (CMSC) opened on the Johns Hopkins campus to better provide patient care to their pediatric patients. The addition meant that for the first time, parents were able to sleep in the same room as their children, a rare occurrence for children's hospitals at the time. After the new Charlotte R. Bloomberg Children's Center opened in 2012, the CMSC was decommissioned and turned into a laboratory space and space to simulate a hospital environment for trainees. Plans have also been made to construct a new facade and renovate the CMSC to house more research programs.\n\nIn May 2012, the Johns Hopkins Hospital opened two new towers as part of a major campus redevelopment effort. The opening of the new $1.1 billion Charlotte R. Bloomberg Children's Center tower and the new adult Sheikh Zayed Tower marked the high point of this effort. The tower provides 560,000 square feet and many new modern amenities. The new towers featured colorful exteriors designed by artist Spencer Finch, and general design from the design firm, Perkins and Will.\n\nCharlotte R. Bloomberg Children's Center got its name when former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg donated $120 million to the construction of the new children's tower.\n\nAbout \nThe hospital has an American Academy of Pediatrics verified level IV neonatal intensive care unit that has a capacity of 45 bassinets. The hospital also has a 40-bed pediatric intensive care unit for critical pediatric patients age 0-21. The hospital also features 10 operating rooms.\n\nAwards \nJohns Hopkins Children's Center is regularly regarded as a national leader in pediatrics.\n\nThrough their affiliation with Johns Hopkins Hospital, JHCC has been recognized by the American Nursing Association as a Magnet hospital for the years 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018.\n\nParents Magazine has ranked the hospital as one if the best 20 best children's hospitals in the country in their top 20 pediatric technology and innovations rankings.\n\nAs of 2021 Johns Hopkins Children's Center has placed nationally in all 10 ranked pediatric specialties on U.S. News & World Report: Best Children's Hospital rankings.\n\nPatient care units \nThe hospital offers a few different units for infants, children, teens, and young adults age 0-21 based on age or diagnosis.\n\n 20-bed Pediatric Medical and Surgical Oncology\n 40-bed Pediatric Intensive Care Unit\n 45-bed Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit\n 35-bed Pediatric Emergency Department\n 62-bed General Pediatric Units (based on age)\n\nFirsts \nThe first ever successful separation of conjoined twins occurred at the hospital on September 7, 1987. The twins, Patrick and Benjamin Binder were the first twins to be successfully separated in the world. The separation was led by neurosurgeon Ben Carson, of Baltimore, Maryland.  For this operation Carson was able to prepare by studying a three-dimensional physical model of the twins' anatomy.  Carson described this separation as the first of its kind, with 23 similar attempted separations ending in the death of one or both twins.\n\nNotable staff \n\n Ben Carson - Former chief of pediatric neurosurgery, former Secretary of H.U.D. former presidential candidate\n Leo Kanner - Founder of the specialty, Child and Adolescent psychiatry\n Helen B.

{"eng_Latn":"Ren\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Prinet (31 December 1861, Vitry-le-Fran\u00e7ois \u2013 26 January 1946, Bourbonne-les-Bains) was a French painter and illustrator who drew his subjects from middle-class society.\n\nBiography \nHe was born to Henri Prinet, an Imperial Prosecutor in Vitry-le-Fran\u00e7ois. A promotion led to him being posted in Paris, where they lived in a home not far from the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts. His father painted as a hobby and was supportive of his desire to study art, having him seek the advice of , a well-known church painter and friend of the family.\n\nAround 1880, he began his studies in earnest, in the studios of Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me; remaining with him until 1885. That year, his painting \"The Infant Jesus\" was accepted for display at the Salon. This was followed by studies at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian. At this time, he also became associated with a group of young artists known as the Bande Noire (Black Stripe), which included Lucien Simon, Andr\u00e9 Dauchez, \u00c9mile-Ren\u00e9 M\u00e9nard and Charles Cottet. Later, he was named a Professor at the \u00c9cole Nationale, where he created and directed their first workshop for female artists.\n\nIn 1891, he received a commission from the government to create decorations in the Palais de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur and he submitted a design for \"The Four Seasons\", which was approved. That same year, he began exhibiting at the Durand-Ruel gallery. One of his best known works, The Kreutzer Sonata (inspired by the story by Tolstoy), was shown in Stuttgart and was purchased by Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria. He was named a Knight in the Legion of Honor in 1900. \n\nHe produced his first illustrations in 1909, for  (The Well-Bred Young Girl) by Ren\u00e9 Boylesve. Over the course of his career, he would illustrate works by Balzac, Pierre Loti, Anatole France and Henri Bataille; among many others.\n\nIn 1913, he was appointed Secretary for the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts and travelled to the United States; serving on the jury for an exhibition at Carnegie Mellon University, where he also presented several works. He would exhibit there again in 1920. Six years later the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Belfortaine des Beaux-Arts\" (an adjunct of the ) was established and became one of his favorite exhibition venues. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.\n\nIn 1943, he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts to fill the chair made vacant by the death of Jules-Alexis Muenier in 1942.

{"eng_Latn":"G.S. Sohan Singh (August 1914 \u2013 28 February 1999) was a Punjabi Sikh artist.\n\nBiography \nSohan Singh was born in August 1914 in Amritsar, British Punjab (now Punjab, India). He was the son of Punjabi artist Gian Singh Naqqash and an apprentice of Hari Singh. He attended school at Government High School, Amritsar up to the middle standard. He had been instructed in the traditional Sikh school of art by his father, Gian Singh, but instead Sohan Singh opted for working with oil on canvas despite this education. He was also taught the Kangra, Pahari, and Mughal schools of painting. In 1932, he painted a now famous portrait of Banda Singh Bahadur which was a massive success with the public and jump-started his career as an artist. He painted hundreds of portraits of famous Sikh personalities which includes portraits Guru Ram Das, Guru Nanak Dev, Jassa Singh Ramgarhia, and Bhai Kanhaiya. His style of painting was realistic, with focus on landscapes, Indian monuments, portraits, and imaginative subjects.\n\nLegacy \nHe had two sons, named Surinder Singh (born 1938) and Satpal Singh 'Danish' (born 1949), the latter of whom is outspoken on the conservation of Sikh art heritage. Surinder Singh was old enough to remember seeing his grandfather, Gian Singh, at work. Surinder Singh learnt about block printing (specifically in monochrome and tri-colour) with his father, Sohan Singh. Surinder Singh would go on to become a successful and accomplished artist and photographer in his own regard. Surinder Singh was also active in preserving the art heritage produced and mastered by his forebearers.  \n\nSatpal Singh 'Danish' became an accomplished photographic journalist working for the press, taking pictures of and documenting many historical events, such as Operation Blue Star, Operation Black Thunder, and the Punjab Insurgency. He became a realistic painter like his father, Sohan. Furthermore, he creates poetry in the Punjabi-language and also is an author for Punjabi-language newspaper publications.\n\nSohan's grandson, Hardeep Singh, is continuing the family legacy and is a painter as well, with an interest also in Gurmukhi calligraphy. Hardeep Singh creates calligraphy in the traditional scriptio continua method of writing Gurmukhi, with the endonym term being larivaar. He also has created his own font set and written literature on Punjabi and Gurmukhi calligraphy.\n\nThe G. S. Sohan Singh Artist Memorial Trust is his namesake organization which was founded by his sons and grandson for the purpose of promoting the Sikh school of art.\n\nA granddaughter, Kirandeep Kaur, has authored two Punjabi books, one being on Sohan Singh and his legacy, Darvesh Chitrakar (2015) on G.S.

In Women and Politics in Chile, Franceschet studies the obstacles to gender equality in the party politics of Chile, investigating gender divisions in civic participation throughout the rise of the Chilean welfare state and expansion of democracy from 1932 to 1973, the authoritarian regime from 1973 to 1990, and the subsequent reintroduction of democracy. The book addresses a puzzle in Chile's recent political history: despite the very high activity of the feminist movement during the Pinochet regime, and the election around the time of the book's publication of Michelle Bachelet as the first woman to be president of Chile, nevertheless women remain starkly underrepresented in Chile's governing institutions. Franceschet identifies a tension within feminist activist movements in Chile between a pro-autonomy position that emphasizes distance from the state, and a double militancy position of being both a member of the feminist movement and working within the state, and she traces this tension back to the first wave of feminist activism in Chile in the early 20th century.

{"eng_Latn":"Approximately 2,100 people developed The Last of Us Part II over more than five years, led by the 350-person team at Naughty Dog. Sony Interactive Entertainment published the action-adventure game in June 2020 for the PlayStation 4. A sequel to the 2013 game The Last of Us, core development on Part II began after the 2014 release of The Last of Us Remastered. Neil Druckmann returned as creative director, co-writing the story with Halley Gross, while Anthony Newman and Kurt Margenau were selected to be co-game directors.\n\nAfter its announcement in 2016, the game was fervently promoted with press showings, cinematic trailers, and special editions. Its release date was subject to several delays, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The development reportedly included a crunch schedule of 12-hour work days and was slowed by the enormous turnover of employees following the development of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (2016), while the team was forced to operate via remote work arrangements in the final months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Development costs for Part II totaled around , making it one of the most expensive video games to develop.\n\nFor the story, Druckmann was inspired by his own experiences growing up in the West Bank, where violence was a frequent topic. Gross also took her own experience with post-traumatic stress disorder with the game's characters. Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker reprised their roles as Ellie and Joel, respectively, recording their motion and voice simultaneously. Ellie is one of two main playable characters in the game; the other, Abby, was portrayed by Laura Bailey. The change was inspired by a similar switch in the first game. The writers wanted to portray Abby's vulnerabilities, aware that players would likely initially dislike her but eventually empathize.\n\nThe developers pushed the technical capabilities of the PlayStation 4 for Part II, creating larger environments and adding more enemies than previously. The advancement of the game's artificial intelligence granted deeper connections with characters; some gameplay elements were similarly intended to create an emotional response from players. The game was originally planned as an open world game, but became more linear to better serve the narrative. The accessibility options were seen as an extension of those introduced in Uncharted 4, and the developers attended conferences and worked with advocates. Gustavo Santaolalla returned to compose and perform the score; Mac Quayle contributed additional combat music.\n\nHistory and overview \n\nApproximately 2,169 developers across 14 studios worked on The Last of Us Part II. Story concepts were first conceived in late 2013, following the development and release of The Last of Us. Development began in 2014, soon after the release of The Last of Us Remastered. By August 2017, with the release of Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, the entire 350-person team at Naughty Dog had shifted to develop Part II. Neil Druckmann led development as creative director and writer, reprising his role from The Last of Us and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (2016). Bruce Straley, game director on the original game, left Naughty Dog in 2017; Druckmann felt that the dynamic on Part II, the first game he co-directed without Straley, was different as a result.\n\nAnthony Newman and Kurt Margenau were selected to be co-game directors for Part II, a first for Naughty Dog as the position was previously held by one person. Both were hired during the development of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves (2009); Newman was the melee combat designer for The Last of Us, and Margenau was game director on Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. Margenau and Newman oversaw and approved the gameplay elements, such as level design and mechanics. Co-lead game designers Emilia Schatz and Richard Cambier were also part of the creative leadership team, continuing their roles from the development of Uncharted 4.\n\nDruckmann identified that, while Naughty Dog was granted the freedom to create any type of game, they were energized when presented the option to make a sequel to The Last of Us due to the importance of the characters, despite knowing it would divide some fans. The team subtitled the game as Part II because they viewed it as an extension of the first. Druckmann wanted Part II to be as effective a sequel as The Godfather Part II (1974) was to The Godfather (1972). As resources were shifted to improving the scale of the game, plans for multiplayer were canceled, shifted to a standalone game. Naughty Dog stated that The Last of Us Part II was the longest game they had made.\n\nFor the final months of development, the team shifted to remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, though they were given the option to do so prior to the mandatory stay-at-home order in California; the operations management department ensured the transition was smooth, as the studio housed technology such as development kits that were not accessible in home setups. Druckmann felt lucky that development was almost complete by the time the pandemic spread in the United States. Game development ceased by May 4, 2020, when it was submitted for manufacturing. According to documents from publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment, the 70-month development peaked at 200 full-time employees and cost around , making it one of the most expensive video games to develop.\n\nThe development, according to a report by Kotakus Jason Schreier, included a crunch schedule of 12-hour work days owing to the studio culture; after the game's delay, developers continued under this schedule for the additional months. Schreier suggested that development was affected and slowed due to the enormous turnover of employees following the development of Uncharted 4, with few veterans left on the team. Some of the developers working on the game allegedly hoped that the game would fail to prove that the working conditions they are under are not viable. Sony granted Naughty Dog an additional two weeks of development for bug fixes. Druckmann felt that he failed to find the correct balance for employees on Part II, and said the studio would receive external assistance for future projects.\n\nStory and setting \n\nDruckmann, who was promoted to Vice President of Naughty Dog in 2018, had less time to write on Part II than on The Last of Us; he wrote the majority of the latter, but less than half of the former. Halley Gross was approached to collaborate as a writer on the game shortly after she had completed her work on Westworld in 2016. She was hired as a writer early in development to help Druckmann outline the story and decipher characters. She felt that she and Druckmann had very similar tastes and interests. When Gross joined the project, Druckmann had a structure for the entire story; Gross felt that her perspective on characters and trauma added to the narrative. When crafting the story further, Druckmann and Gross created an outline and presented it to the studio to \"stress-test\" it. They then worked in non-chronological order with animators, layout designers, and other departments to develop ideas. Each section of the game was mapped on a wall using notecards; a section was scrapped if it did not contribute to the overall narrative momentum, or was \"just cool for the sake of being cool\". Druckmann found that the additional voice of Gross led to more believable characters, particularly regarding romance and comedy. When she assumed more responsibilities about two years into development, Gross was given the title of \"narrative lead\". Josh Scherr and Ryan James contributed to additional in-game dialogue, with Scherr also writing the descriptions of the collectible cards.\n\nDruckmann felt that his time working on Uncharted 4 for two years allowed the story of Part II to slowly develop. The team experimented with different plot structures and considered scrapping the game entirely until they settled on an idea that mirrored the first game; Druckmann identified that The Last of Us is about the extreme measures one would take for love, whereas Part II is more about how far one would go to bring justice for those they love. He initially stated that, while the first game focuses on love, Part II centers on hate; he later rephrased that both games are about love, analyzing the best and worst it can offer. He felt that the town of Jackson represented the best, as its population attempted to live morally in a world representing the real one, while the war between the Washington Liberation Front (WLF) and the Seraphites demonstrates the worst, despite some glimpses of hope within the lives of the former. Druckmann predicted that some players would dislike the game's story, but said that he would prefer passionate hate over apathy. He found that some players considered the characters in the first game to be \"sacred\" and wanted to ensure that was not the case with the sequel.\n\nThe game's themes of revenge and retribution were inspired by Druckmann's own experiences growing up in the West Bank, where violence was a frequent topic. He specifically recalled watching footage of the 2000 Ramallah lynching and how, after hearing the cheering crowds, his mind immediately turned to violent thoughts of revenge against them; he later admitted to feeling \"gross and guilty\" for having these thoughts. He wanted the player to feel a \"thirst for revenge\" before making them realize the reality of their actions. Once he had settled on a basic concept, the remainder of the narrative outline was complete within weeks. He noted that some members of the team felt reluctant about the game's cynicism, but ultimately he preferred a divisive story than a \"mundane\" one. He found that stories showing the cost of revenge were more nuanced, and wanted to use the interactivity of the medium to push these feelings to players. He found that people often want to bring someone to justice after witnessing a horrible act, but are unable to do so due to laws and society; in the game's world, where these societal structures no longer exist, he saw an opportunity to explore this concept. When researching for the game, he watched the documentary films Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills (1996) and its sequels Revelations (2000) and Purgatory (2011), and found it particularly interesting when parents would make comments in interviews about wanting to hurt or kill the West Memphis Three over the murder allegations; he felt that these comments were the \"perversion of love\", wanting to commit a heinous act to bring justice for those they love. He also referenced Dave Grossman's 1996 book On Killing, which discusses the desensitization of violence for soldiers.\n\nDruckmann noted that the game's other themes include tribalism, trauma, and the pursuit of justice. He felt that humans often dehumanize those they oppose in order to justify their own actions in the chase for justice; he found this particularly relevant in modern politics and online discourse, and wanted to explore it within the game without being overly \"preachy\". Gross added that \"one man's justice is another man's revenge\" and wanted the story to show different perspectives and consequences. Druckmann felt that the depiction of violent acts was necessary in a story that deals with the cycle of violence, but welcomed members of the team to work on other elements of the game if anything made them uncomfortable. Co-art director John Sweeney pushed for realism in the violence, particularly with minimizing it instead of embellishing. The inclusion of a PlayStation Vita playing Hotline Miami (2012), a game with similar themes about violence of which Druckmann and the team are fans, was considered an extension of the theme; earlier versions used another Naughty Dog game, but Dennaton Games allowed the team to use Hotline Miami. Cambier noted that Ellie's violent acts are committed for love or for hate, and were therefore justified by the narrative.\n\nThe game underwent several changes throughout production. Initial pre-production concepts included Ellie discovering information about other immune people. Later in development, the game had five days in Seattle instead of three, including an additional side story wherein Ellie traveled to the Seraphite island, which was intended to humanize the Seraphite characters more. An earlier version of the farm sequence featured a playable sequence of Ellie hunting a boar; gameplay, art, and performance was completed, but the sequence was cut for pacing purposes and is instead referenced in Ellie's journal. In an earlier draft, Joel had a girlfriend named Esther, who was originally mentioned as part of a live performance of some scenes from the first game called The Last of Us: One Night Live (2014). In the drafts, Esther lived in a town about two hours away from Jackson. In an early version of a flashback, Ellie and Joel traveled to Esther and found that she had been bitten; her death triggered a conversation between Ellie and Joel about a cure. The character was later scrapped as the writers felt she was established too quickly, and was more relevant to Joel's arc than Ellie's. A love letter from Esther remained for some time afterwards, but was eventually cut from the final game.\n\nDruckmann identified that the first game's pacing was like a film, but he wanted Part II to be reflective of a novel, with several quiet moments. Some of the game's dialogue was inspired by the British dark comedy series The End of the F***ing World (2017\u20132019). The notes scattered around the world were developed out of discussions with the team; as a level was built, the team would discuss the stories behind particular objects in the environment. The team decided to use Seattle as the game's primary location as its hilly nature and varied weather led to more interesting gameplay scenarios. Artists at Naughty Dog traveled to Seattle to analyze the architecture, vegetation, materials, topography, and lighting, and capture photorealistic textures. The team experimented with larger open world environments in Part II, as they had previously done with Uncharted 4 and The Lost Legacy. Druckmann wanted the open world of Seattle to contribute to Ellie feeling lost and frustrated. The final chapter of the game originally took place in Mexico before being moved to Santa Barbara, California.\n\nCharacter development \n\nAshley Johnson and Troy Baker reprise their roles as Ellie and Joel, respectively. Druckmann pitched the narrative to Johnson at a restaurant during early development of The Last of Us: Left Behind (2014), and to Baker after the 10th British Academy Games Awards. Druckmann recalled that Johnson's approval was the first feeling of validation for the narrative. The actors' performance were recorded at a studio in Playa Vista, Los Angeles using performance capture, recording motion and voice simultaneously. The actors wore motion capture suits and head-mounted cameras that track facial muscles and eye movements. Recording ran from 2017 to April 2019. The actors were allowed to improvise or suggest ideas while performing; Druckmann said that he would do \"20 or 30 takes if need be\". Gross noted that a goal of the writers was to \"create the most multifaceted characters you've seen in games\". She particularly wanted to explore the multifaceted behavior of Ellie, showing her power as well as her insecurities. She wanted the story to show that \"there are no heroes or villains\". Druckmann found that all three playable characters\u2014Joel in the first game, and Ellie and Abby in Part II\u2014mirror each other as they are all suffering with overcoming trauma and \"quietening their demons\".\n\nDruckmann recalled the team's excitement to explore Ellie's character further as a protagonist, particularly developing the loss of her innocence, comparing it to the feeling of the writers of Breaking Bad (2008\u20132013) when given the opportunity to explore Walter White. The team discussed creating a sequel without Ellie and Joel, but felt that they were less interesting. For her portrayal as the primary playable character, Johnson took lessons she learned working with Baker on the first game. Johnson considered her own experiences with anxiety, and researched the effects of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with Druckmann. Ellie's excitement for astronomy was based on Johnson's own interests, while her obsession with comics is based on Druckmann's childhood.\n\nLead character artist Ashley Swidowski designed Ellie's eyes to demonstrate a somberness not present in the first game, which used wider eyes to reflect her childlike nature. Ellie's tattoo of a moth was designed by California-based artist Natalie Hall after the team struggled to settle on a design. Hall drew the tattoo on a developer's arm so the team could visualize it. When Swidowski added the moth design to Ellie's guitar, the team created a connection between it and the tattoo. Druckmann felt that moths' obsession with light mirrored Ellie's obsession throughout the game, as well as giving her a reminder of Joel. Ellie's clothing in the game is designed to wrinkle authentically. Ellie's journal was a late addition to development, intended to allow further insight into her mindset.\n\nThe game's flashback sequences of Ellie and Joel served as a way to contextualize the former's motivations and remind the player the reason behind her journey. The writers ensured that the flashbacks featured some conflict to avoid their relationship remaining idle; the writers felt that avoiding the consequences of Joel's actions at the end of the first game would be a \"disservice\" to the themes of Part II. Druckmann recalled that the flashbacks were \"all over the place, out of order\" initially, and that Gross's work on the game included their simplification. The dance scene between Ellie and Dina was originally the game's opening; once the writers realized that its placement would force the opening cutscene to be 25 minutes long, they moved it towards the end of the game as a flashback, where they felt it had a stronger impact. In the final flashback, Ellie and Joel originally hugged until Johnson suggested otherwise.\n\nThe change of player character from Ellie to Abby was inspired by the change from Joel to Ellie in the first game, though emphasized in Part II due to its focus on empathy. Druckmann found that players acted differently when forced to play as Ellie in the first game, and wanted to replicate a similar change with Abby in Part II. Druckmann was also inspired by the character switch of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001), which had been suppressed in that game's marketing. The switch to Abby in the game's first chapter was done to demonstrate her personality and vulnerabilities and avoid her portrayal as a typical antagonist. The writers experimented with interspersing Ellie and Abby's gameplay sections, but ultimately settled on longer segments. Druckmann found that Ellie's attempt for revenge was mirrored by Abby, who had already achieved it by avenging her father. Early playtests of the final fight led to confusion regarding Ellie's decision to spare Abby; the editorial team suggested adding a flash of Joel playing guitar, which Druckmann felt was an effective balance between explicit and implicit motivation. For more than half of production, Ellie killed Abby in the game's conclusion, and would return to the farm and be tortured but spared by a relative of somebody Ellie killed. Druckmann felt that this was thematically relevant, but realized that it focused too heavily on the themes rather than characters; after conversations about Yara and Lev, they found that it felt dishonest and that Ellie still had some goodness. Druckmann wanted players to support both characters in the final fight, and realize how futile it is.\n\nGross felt that Ellie's decision to track down Abby was motivated by her desire to overcome her PTSD more than her desire to kill Abby. Gross, who has suffered twice from PTSD, considered it her responsibility to accurately depict the subject matter; she wanted players who might have suffered with trauma to understand that they are not alone. The writers wanted to deconstruct the perception of violence in Joel and Ellie: while Joel is indifferent and practical, Ellie kills to maintain a \"culture of honor\" by attaching violence to her ego. Some of the team considered Ellie's obsession with Abby akin to a drug addiction, and that Dina left as she felt that the obsession would never end. Gross considered the game's final shot, wherein Ellie leaves behind the guitar that Joel gave her, represented Ellie moving on from his death to a new chapter. Druckmann felt that it illustrated Ellie finally overcoming her ego, though he preferred that the player create their own interpretation.\n\nDruckmann felt that Joel's character arc was complete after the first game. Joel's death was a core part of the game's narrative structure from early in development; Druckmann considered it one of the most difficult to write, rehearse, and shoot. Though it initially caused some internal resistance, the team felt compelled when more of the narrative was built out. An early version of Joel's death scene had him utter \"Sarah\", his daughter's name, until Baker suggested that he should remain silent. While Sarah's death in the first game intended to evoke sadness, Joel's death aims to elicit anger. Ellie was originally absent during the scene, and was to be informed by Joel's brother Tommy, but Druckmann felt that witnessing the death through Ellie's perspective emphasized the anger of the player. He wanted it to be portrayed as \"gross, unceremonious, and humiliating\" instead of heroic; it was originally more gruesome, but later toned down as the gore was not crucial to the scene. He predicted that it might lead to negative reactions, but felt it was necessary to tell the story; he particularly felt that Naughty Dog's notability in the industry gave it the opportunity to take risks that other developers could not. In an earlier version of the scene, Abby stabbed Joel in the back and twisted the knife to paralyze him; however, as knives are more closely associated with Ellie, the team replaced it with a golf club to demonstrate Abby's blunt force attacks.\n\nWhen auditioning actors for Abby, Druckmann specifically wanted to avoid casting Laura Bailey due to her proliferation of roles; he had originally considered Bailey to play Dina. When reviewing her audition tape, however, Druckmann was impressed by how Bailey had played into Abby's vulnerability, whereas other actors emphasized her anger. Bailey considers the game important to her personally, as she gave birth to her first son during production. Prior to her pregnancy, Bailey was working out in preparation for the role. She also prepared by researching people involved in wars and their coping mechanisms. An early iteration of the story had a young Abby witnessing an attack on her group by Joel and Tommy, who were hunters at the time (in the unseen 20 years of the first game), and vowing revenge. As the story and its theme of violence developed, the writers found it more interesting for Abby's father to have been killed by the player in the first game and directly tie into Joel's actions. Druckmann wanted players to hate Abby early in the game, but later empathize with her; he avoided writing her as a \"perfect\" character, instead prompting empathy through her flaws and redemptive actions.\n\nSome of the game's flashback scenes with Abby initially depicted her joining the WLF, though it was an unconscious decision on her behalf, as the leader of the WLF was a fellow member of her former group and acted as a father figure for her. Abby's goal to kill Joel was fueled by her desire to return to a world before her father's death, but she discovers it impossible. After witnessing Owen's battle for light, she finds her own purpose in protecting Yara and Lev, which Druckmann felt mirrored Joel's redemption arc from the first game. The obstacles she overcomes when gathering medical supplies demonstrates the lengths to which she will go to help the children and redeem herself. Margenau felt that Abby was inspired to abandon her alliances after witnessing Lev's rebellious nature. Abby's plea to the Santa Barbara Rattlers to leave Lev alone is an intentional parallel with Ellie's plea to spare Joel earlier in the game. When Ellie holds Abby underwater in their final fight, Bailey held her breath while recording; she recalled that Johnson let her go when she saw Bailey's lips turning blue. Bailey felt that, in the game's conclusion, Abby understands Ellie's emotions, having dealt with her own father's death.\n\nGross connected actress Shannon Woodward, with whom she had worked on Westworld, with Druckmann. A fan of Westworld, Druckmann spoke with Woodward for several months before offering her an audition to play Dina. Johnson recalled that the team had narrowed the potential cast to around four actors. After testing with Woodward, Johnson felt that they immediately had chemistry; Woodward was later cast as the character. Woodward felt that some people deal with trauma through comedy, and would often improvise jokes while recording. As a narrative function, Dina represented the community of Jackson, and what Ellie stood to lose from her revenge mission. Her presence allowed Ellie moments of light. Gross had originally written an extended monologue for Ellie to perform to Dina about her fear of ruining their friendship.\n\nOriginally in development, Lev was not transgender. An early pitch was for Yara (portrayed by Victoria Grace) to be transgender, but Druckmann preferred to keep her a more traditional follower of the Seraphites. Queer and transgender employees of Naughty Dog gave input on the character, and the team consulted with an LGBTQ scholar. When the developers reached out to acting agencies to cast for the character, they found that none represented transgender actors. Some members of the team were fans of The OA (2016\u20132019), which starred Ian Alexander; though he was not represented by an agency at the time, Alexander was invited by Druckmann to audition. When exploring the idea of making Lev transgender, the team found it to be an interesting look into the violence that can be found within organized religion. Alexander was attracted to the role as he underwent similar emotions when transitioning, having come from a religious background and also receiving backlash after cutting his hair. He felt that Lev has been forced to grow up due to his surroundings. Despite some hesitation, the team determined that Lev's deadname being used by the Seraphites demonstrated the difference between their transphobia and Abby and Yara's acceptance. The team hired a religious consultant to ensure the Seraphites' response to Lev's transition was accurate without being unintentionally offensive. Druckmann considered Lev among the most important characters as he represents the same innocence that Ellie did in the first game.\n\nTechnical and gameplay development \n\nThe developers pushed the technical capabilities of the PlayStation 4 when creating Part II, adding more enemies and larger environments than in previous games. Druckmann noted that any drops in detail would ruin the game's authenticity, which required consistent optimization of the technology. The team created a new animation technique called \"motion mapping\" for the characters, which allows for more realistic transitions between movement actions. The advancement of the game's artificial intelligence (AI) allowed for deeper connections with characters and the creation of bonds through gameplay. Enemy AI also have more complex understanding of the player's location at any given time. The additional animations required more significant amounts of data and motion capture performances than previously. Horses and dogs were motion captured for movement in the game.\n\nThe Last of Us Part II was originally planned as an open world game with hub worlds in Jackson and Seattle\u2014the player would initially complete missions in the former as Abby before she revealed her true intentions, and later in the former as Ellie while she tracks down Abby\u2014but the game transferred to a more linear style as it better served the narrative. Ellie's agility prompted the addition of new gameplay features, including puzzle and traversal sections, and more advanced dodging and stealth mechanics. Margenau wanted the new gameplay features to immerse the player in the world without feeling \"gamey\". The introduction of some gameplay elements, such as the tracking dogs and named enemies, was intended to create an emotional response. The team also emphasized the importance of Ellie's weapons to form a realistic attachment from the player, though Druckmann noted that the narrative tension was more important than the gameplay realism in some instances, such as the amount of enemies that Ellie kills. The glass-breaking mechanic was seen as a \"big win\" for development due to its technical difficulty and versatility for level design. Early prototypes included a companion dog for Ellie, who could fit under fences and fetch items.\n\nSome scenes in the game, such as Owen and Mel's death from Ellie's perspective, were originally depicted as gameplay but later converted to non-interactive cutscenes to emphasize their impact. The dance scene between Ellie and Dina was originally interactive and more extensive, featuring sequences wherein the player could mix drinks, chase children, and interact with Cat, Ellie's ex-girlfriend, but the sequence was eventually cut for narrative purposes. Ellie and Dina's kiss was one of the most demanding scenes to animate. It was recorded in two ways: without the face camera helmets so the actors could kiss, and kissing the air with the helmets so the animators had a reference for the facial movement. Lead cinematic animator Eric Baldwin said that the minute details that had to be implemented in the graphics software Autodesk Maya included dynamic hair strands and cheek flushness.\n\nIn Part II, Naughty Dog wanted to increase the accessibility options introduced in Uncharted 4 to ensure that all players could complete the story. The developers attended conferences and worked with advocates like Brandon Cole and Can I Play That? media editor Steve Saylor during the process. The game has around 60 accessibility options, including audio clues, visual aids, and customizable controls. The team began planning the features during early production, which game designer Matthew Gallant felt was the reason they added so many; in particular, high-contrast mode, customizable controls, and text-to-speech required the most resources. The designers ensured that the game's tone and themes remained consistent with the accessibility options enabled. Schatz found the visual options particularly challenging due to the spectrum of visual impairments. When a developer suggested an accessibility option to censor the violence against dogs, Druckmann refused as it would impact the narrative too heavily. He felt that including an option to censor gore would lessen the discomfort intended by the story. Members of the team worked extra hours to ensure the addition of the accessibility options, despite Druckmann instructing them otherwise.\n\nMusic production \n\nGustavo Santaolalla returned to compose and perform the score, as he had done with the first game. He was tasked with creating the emotional, character-based tracks. Santaolalla worked on the game for around two to three years. Instead of scoring directly to the game's material, he created music based on the story pitch by Druckmann, and the two later collaborated to fit the music into the scenes, where it would occasionally require a minor rewrite. He delivered small parts of the music over time, often inspiring Druckmann to write new scenes based on the tracks. With elements of the game still in development, Santaolalla worked with the story, characters, and artwork to craft the score, though he felt that his work on the first game ensured that he was already familiar with \"the visual language\". He wanted to maintain and extend motifs from the first game while introducing new elements. Santaolalla continued to use the ronroco, his signature instrument used in the first game's main theme, as he felt it enhanced Ellie's qualities through feminine sounds. Part IIs main theme uses a banjo, which Santaolalla felt reflected the game's American setting and origin; he was initially hesitant in using it, but the developers encouraged him to do so. The music during Joel's death scene intended to build dread but feel inevitable, as opposed to the surprise and sadness invoked during Sarah's death in the first game. Druckmann wanted to achieve moments in which the music conveys narrative elements: after Abby collects the medicine to save Yara, the music symbolizes her redemption; when she protects Lev in the game's conclusion, the music represents their relationship.\n\nMac Quayle contributed to the game's combat music. He was hired on the project in early 2018; the developers were familiar with his previous work on the television series Mr. Robot. Largely unfamiliar with gaming, Quayle immediately bought a PlayStation 4 and a copy of The Last of Us to familiarise himself with the series before meeting to discuss the second game. He began writing ideas for the game in May 2018, and delivered his final music in January 2020; he found the deadlines much more relaxed compared to film and television projects. The team discussed potential collaborations between Santaolalla and Quayle, including sharing stems and sessions, though ultimately their collaborations were minimal; they performed a three-day recording session in the PlayStation offices in October 2018, where they experimented with different sounds and instruments to create \"grooves and textures\" that were later used in the game. Quayle attributed the similarities between their work to the developers \"really knowing what they wanted\". Quayle's music aimed to represent the \"relentless tension\" of the gameplay sequences, consistently moving the action forward and heightening the suspense and anxiety. The developers wanted to avoid music that sounded \"too electronic or too organic and natural\". Quayle was provided with videos of early gameplay captures for inspiration, instead of composing directly to scenes. He used Logic Pro for his work, which he used to heavily manipulate the several live acoustic instruments. His favorite instruments on the project were the bass guitar and cello; for the latter, he brought in a professional cellist.\n\nThe in-game covers became a significant part of the characters and their development, namely Ellie with her guitar. Druckmann found that Ellie's guitar-playing allowed her access to memories and emotions; when she loses her fingers in the game's conclusion, it serves to sever ties to her memories and relationships. The song \"Future Days\" by Pearl Jam acts as a theme between Ellie and Joel throughout the game. The song was previously featured as part of One Night Live in an unbroadcast epilogue wherein Joel plays the song to Ellie. According to Druckmann, Sony was doubtful that Naughty Dog would receive permission to use the song; the band's manager agreed after hearing the story pitch, receiving a PlayStation 4 and a copy of the original game, and an advanced screening of a trailer. Although the song's album Lightning Bolt was released two weeks after the onset of the in-game outbreak in September 2013, Druckmann recalled seeing a live performance of the song several months earlier in July, and felt that its inclusion was realistic.\n\nShawn James was contacted by Sony in mid-2014 for permission to create a cover of his song \"Through the Valley\" for an upcoming game; James was unaware of how it would be used until he watched the game's first trailer at the PlayStation Experience in December 2016. Druckmann had specifically enjoyed the song and felt that it aligned with the game's darkness and emotion. The song went viral after the trailer's release, charting atop the Spotify viral charts in the United Kingdom. Naughty Dog was able to secure permission to use \"Take On Me\" by A-ha in one of the game's scenes due to Gross's friendship with Lauren Savoy, the wife of A-ha guitarist Paul Waaktaar-Savoy. Druckmann found that the song's lyrics addressed the game's themes in a lighthearted manner. He felt that the scene featuring the song being optional made it feel more important to the player, though the team considered making it unmissable instead. After Johnson worked with vocal coach Melissa Reese, the team felt that her singing was too refined, and asked her to consciously sing worse.\n\nSound design \nA sound designer at Naughty Dog created a system that tracks the player character's level of exertion and plays matching respiratory audio effects. To create the sound effects for the Shambler, sound designer Beau Anthony Jimenez made a palatal clicking noise into a padded bucket via a tube, which he recorded with an ultrasonic microphone. He added this atop a slowed-down palatal sound to create the \"Shambler Bark\". Voice actors Raul Ceballos and Steve Blum contributed to the Shambler sounds, the former to screams and the latter to grunts. The explosion sounds were created by squeezing grapefruit and expanding a life jacket; for additional texture, he filled a bellows with oatmeal and blew it. The audio of the resulting acid cloud was achieved by dripping water on a pilot light and melting ice over a hot pan.\n\nThe whistling of the Seraphites was a long-discussed element of the game; production began in early 2018 in preparation for an upcoming demonstration. The team originally referenced whistled languages such as Sfryria and Silbo Gomero but found that they were more sophisticated than necessary. They also worked with a professional whistler but found the result too \"birdlike\". Dialogue supervisor Maged Khalil and UI artist Maria Capel recorded around an hour of sample whistles, which dialogue coordinator Grayson Stone organized into 14 groups dependent on duration, trill, intensity, and tone. After some iteration, the team decided on 26 categories, each representing lines the Seraphites use to communicate. Actors Stevie Mack and Lisa Marie provided the final whistles in three styles, each in a different level of quality. The team wanted the subtitles to represent the nuance of the whistles without giving away their exact meaning, and consulted accessibility specialist Morgan Baker to create them. The team discussed adding additional communication methods, such as knocking on trees or rattling, but it would have required additional animation, art, and sound design work.\n\nRelease \nThe Last of Us Part II was announced at the PlayStation Experience event on December 3, 2016. At E3 2018, Druckmann said that Naughty Dog was refusing to announce a release date until the game was \"very close to release\", to avoid disappointing fans. During Sony's State of Play presentation on September 24, 2019, Naughty Dog revealed that the game would be released on February 21, 2020. A month later, on October 25, Druckmann announced that the game was delayed to May 29, 2020, to \"bring the entire game up to a level of polish we would call Naughty Dog quality\". On April 2, 2020, Sony announced that the game was almost complete but had been indefinitely delayed to due to logistical problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The team used the additional time for further polishing. In late April, several videos leaked online, showing cutscenes, gameplay, and significant plot details. Druckmann tweeted that he was \"heartbroken\" for fans and for the team, who had devoted years to development. A few days later, Sony stated that it had identified the leakers and that they were not affiliated with Sony or Naughty Dog. According to Schreier, hackers had used a security weakness in a previous Naughty Dog game to penetrate the company's servers. On April 27, Sony announced a new release date of June 19, 2020. A performance update for the game was released on May 19, 2021, allowing gameplay at 60 frames per second on PlayStation 5.\n\nPromotion \n\nThe game was extensively marketed through video trailers. The first trailer was released alongside the game's announcement, showcasing the return of Ellie and Joel, and featured a cover of Shawn James's \"Through the Valley\" by Johnson. The trailer was named the Best Cinematic of 2016 by Behind the Cinematic. At PlayStation Experience in December 2016, Game Informers Andy McNamara moderated a panel with Druckmann, Johnson, and Baker. The second trailer was released in October 2017 as a part of Paris Games Week. It revealed Abby, Yara, and Lev. Druckmann stated that the characters \"are integral to [Ellie and Joel's] next journey\". While the trailer was well-received, it drew some criticism for its violence. IGNs Max Scoville felt that the trailer was \"a little out of touch\" for introducing characters entirely through violence and without context. Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe president Jim Ryan defended the trailer, saying the game is made by and for adults. Druckmann explained: \"We're making a game about the cycle of violence and we're making a statement about violent actions and the impact they have ... [the idea] was for the player to feel repulsed by some of the violence they are committing themselves.\"\n\nAt PlayStation Experience in December 2017, Hannah Hart moderated a panel with Druckmann, Gross, Johnson, Baker, Bailey, Alexander, and Grace; Johnson and Baker opened the panel with a performance of \"The Wayfaring Stranger\". The game was featured at Sony's E3 event in June 2018, revealing Dina and Jesse. The kiss between Ellie and Dina in the presentation was praised for appearing passionate and believable, a feat frequently considered difficult to animate. Critics also praised the improved graphics, enemy artificial intelligence, and combat. Druckmann recalled that the team rehearsed and choreographed the gameplay within the presentation, particularly due to the openness of the level. E3 Coliseum hosted a panel for the game in, moderated by IGNs Lucy O'Brien and featuring Druckmann, Newman, Margenau, Johnson, and Woodward.\n\nAnother trailer was featured in Sony's State of Play presentation in September 2019, followed by some additional marketing to celebrate Outbreak Week\u2014the week in which the fictional outbreak occurred in the original game\u2014including hands-on demonstrations for journalists, behind-the-scenes videos, and merchandise announcements. In the same week, Naughty Dog also announced the special edition versions of the game: the Digital Deluxe Edition features a digital soundtrack, art book, and dynamic theme; the Collector's Edition include the same, as well as a Steelbook case, physical art book, bracelet, and a statue of Ellie; and the Ellie Edition also include a replica of Ellie's backpack and a vinyl record featuring some music from the game.\n\nThe game's story trailer was released on May 6. From May 13 to June 3, Naughty Dog released a series of videos about the development of Part II, discussing the narrative, gameplay, and world. The game was featured in its own standalone State of Play presentation on May 27, revealing an extended gameplay demonstration. An animated commercial was released on June 3, featuring Ellie singing an acoustic cover of \"True Faith\", a song by New Order. The cover is specifically inspired by the version by Lotte Kestner, though she was not credited; when Kestner reached out to Naughty Dog, Druckmann issued an apology and ensured proper credit. The final pre-launch trailer was released on June 10. Druckmann claimed that Sony's marketing department wanted less secrecy surrounding the narrative, but he was unwilling to reveal twists to players. Naughty Dog replaced and altered characters in the trailers to conceal story events; Druckmann cited the marketing of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, which concealed its protagonist in trailers, as an influence. For the game's launch, PlayStation Australia posted a cover of \"Through the Valley\" by Tash Sultana.\n\nThe game received several pieces of merchandise, including clothing, a Funko Pop, and a replica of Ellie's guitar. Sony also released PlayStation 4 hardware and accessories branded with the game's logo and art, including a PlayStation 4 Pro, DualShock 4 controller, wireless headset, and Seagate hard drive. The Art of The Last of Us Part II, a 200-page book featuring art and concepts from the game, was released in June 2020. Following the release, several developers and cast members promoted the game through appearances on online talk shows and podcasts. The Official The Last of Us Podcast, hosted by Christian Spicer and published by Sony, began covering the game from its sixth episode in July 2020, featuring interviews with the cast and developers. For The Last of Us Day in September 2020, Naughty Dog announced new merchandise for the game, including a vinyl soundtrack, board game, statues, and posters. A trailer focusing on Abby's story and gameplay was released on December 3, 2020. For the game's first anniversary in June 2021, new clothing and merchandise was revealed, including a statue of Abby in collaboration with Dark Horse Direct. In August 2022, Naughty Dog announced a partnership with Chivas Brothers to create a whisky based on The Last of Us Part II called Moth & Wolf (resembling Ellie's tattoo and Abby's faction, respectively). A 2013 vintage\u2014representative of the first game's release\u2014the whisky, which sits at 40 percent alcohol by volume, carries notes of vanilla to represent the safety of Jackson, and smoke and malt to imitate the toughness of Seattle. Preorders opened in October.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography \n\nLast of Us, The 2\nThe Last of Us\nSony Interactive Entertainment\nVideo game industry labor disputes"}
{"eng_Latn":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption to motorsport across the world, mirroring its impact across all sports. Across the world and to varying degrees, events and competitions have been cancelled or postponed.\n\nAustralian Supercars\nThe Supercars Championship had planned to hold the Melbourne 400 supporting the Australian Grand Prix. The event was cancelled the same time the Grand Prix was also cancelled. Although the Championship were seeking to hold a replacement event later in the year, it was ultimately not made up.  The Supercars' Tasmania Super400 at Symmons Plains Raceway (originally scheduled for 4\u20135 April), the Auckland Super400 at Hampton Downs (25\u201326 April), and the Perth SuperNight at Wanneroo Raceway (16\u201317 May) rounds were also postponed beyond June. The pandemic saw 23Red Racing withdraw from the championship as its primary sponsor, Milwaukee Tools, ended its deal with the team.\n\nA revised calendar was released on 17 May, with the events at Gold Coast and Newcastle dropped from the calendar and a second race at Bathurst to be held in February 2021.  As well, the Melbourne 400 will still count as a round because practice and qualifying had taken place before the event was cancelled.  After a second revision on 19 June, the second Bathurst round was reassigned to be part of the 2021 season (replacing the Intercontinental GT Challenge round at Bathurst cancelled because of international travel restrictions), with the Sydney SuperNight round being restored and acting as the season finale.  Further revisions saw rounds at Winton, Sandown, Symmons Plains, Wanneroo and the Sydney SuperNight being cancelled, and the Bathurst 1000 now becoming the finale.\n\nSupercars formed the All Stars Eseries to allow its drivers to compete against each other.\n\nDeutsche Tourenwagen Masters\nThe Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters series postponed the start of its championship until August 2020. The Norisring round, which was scheduled on 10\u201312 July, was cancelled because of the difficulties of assembling the infrastructure required for a street circuit and impossibility to be held behind closed doors.\n\nDrag racing\nOn March 12, the National Hot Rod Association suspended its season while some sportsman classes were already contesting the Amalie Motor Oil NHRA Gatornationals; the sportsman classes already active at that time would finish their runs behind closed doors, while the professional and remaining sportsman classes were sent home.\n\nThe season schedule was revised several times during the suspension, with the season eventually being shortened to eleven events from the original twenty-four; the Countdown to the Championship was scrapped for the season amid the first bouts of the rescheduling.  As a result of these changes, with the current schedule revealed as of September 2, Las Vegas saw its two events consolidated into one (which, after the September 2 schedule revisions, became the season finale) with Pomona also reduced to a single race (held prior to the pandemic); the Virginia NHRA Nationals, Summit Racing Equipment NHRA Nationals, Route 66 NHRA Nationals, NHRA Sonoma Nationals, MagicDry Organic Absorbent NHRA Northwest Nationals, and NHRA New England Nationals were removed from the schedule for the season in the earliest schedule modifications; and three additional events were announced in two bursts for Lucas Oil Raceway to relaunch the season from July 11 in order to initially compensate for cancelled events.  The Dodge Mile-High NHRA Nationals and Lucas Oil NHRA Nationals were subsequently postponed on July 17, in conjunction with the third additional event at Lucas Oil Raceway added to the former's original dates; the Menards NHRA Heartland Nationals would also subsequently be postponed on July 29, followed by the cancellation of the Southern Nationals on August 10 and the Mopar Express Lane NHRA Nationals on August 17.  Further schedule revisions on September 2 saw the schedule reduced further, with the three postponed events that were awaiting rescheduling as well as both Charlotte events (which had initially been consolidated to a single event in earlier schedule revisions), the Thunder Valley Nationals (for logistics reasons), and technically, the other Las Vegas Motor Speedway round (the Las Vegas round, known as the Dodge NHRA Vegas Nationals, was officially cancelled).  The NHRA Finals at Pomona was legally moved to the Las Vegas meeting, which is known as the Dodge NHRA Finals (sponsors kept their contracts, but the 2020 Las Vegas race belongs to the World Finals lineage). leaving six previously-scheduled events including the rescheduled aforementioned Gatornationals to finish out the season.\n\nThe rescheduling has created an event-name related oddity, in that the Mopar Express Lane NHRA SpringNationals have retained its name for the season despite now being scheduled for the weekend after the AAA NHRA Fall Nationals in October.\n\nDespite the pandemic, the NHRA was able to host all races were held with spectators in attendance.\n\nThe NHRA then announced the 2021 NHRA season would start at the Gatornationals in March, with the sanctioning body moving the Winternationals and Arizona Nationals to April, hoping that spectator restrictions will be eased by that time.  On 15 January 2021, the NHRA announced that the Wild Horse Pass Motorsports Park round would be moved to another venue to be determined.  On 16 March 2021, the NHRA announced the Auto Club Raceway at Pomona Winternationals was postponed.  On 5 May 2021, the NHRA postponed the round at Virginia Motorsports Park while restoring the round at Bristol Dragway, which moves from June (a date clash with the NASCAR weekend in Gladeville, TN) to October.  On 14 May 2021, with King County, Washington restrictions still questionable, Pacific Raceways was removed, with the Lucas Oil Winternationals moving to the August date.\n\nFormula racing\n\nFormula One\n\n2020 \nThe early 2020 Formula One season was disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. Prior to the start of the season, Ferrari and AlphaTauri expressed concern about the spread of the virus and its effect on the championship. Both teams are based in Italy, which has suffered one of the worst outbreaks of the virus outside China, and so both Ferrari and AlphaTauri were therefore concerned over the ability of their staff to leave a quarantine zone that was established in northern Italy. Ross Brawn, the managing director of the sport, announced that Grands Prix would not go ahead if a team were blocked from entering a host nation, but that events could go ahead if a team voluntarily chose not to enter a host nation.\n\nThe season opening Australian race was abruptly cancelled shortly before the start of the first free practice session, while the Monaco and French races were eventually cancelled. The cancellation of the Monaco Grand Prix meant that 2020 would mark the first time since  that the race has not been held. The Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Canadian, Dutch, Spanish and Vietnamese Grands Prix were postponed, while the Chinese Grand Prix had already been postponed prior to the pandemic. The Dutch Grand Prix would eventually be cancelled on 28 May, the Azerbaijan Grand Prix would eventually be cancelled on 12 June, along with Singapore (due to logistical difficulties associated with establishing a street circuit on short notice) and Japanese (due to travel restrictions by Japanese government). The Canadian Grand Prix would be cancelled on 24 July along with races in Mexico, United States and Brazil due to the travel restrictions in the Americas, while the Spanish Grand Prix would be rescheduled to 16 August on 2 June. On 24 August, the Bahrain Grand Prix would be rescheduled to 29 November and the Chinese Grand Prix was cancelled. On 16 October, the Vietnamese Grand Prix was cancelled. Organizers of the Austrian, British and Hungarian Grands Prix were the first to announce that their races could go ahead, but run without spectators and with teams staffed by minimal personnel. The summer break shut down period\u2014which includes mandatory factory closures as a cost-cutting measure\u2014was also brought forward from August to March and April and was originally extended to three weeks, allowing for postponed races to be held in August.\n\nThe sport had planned to overhaul its technical regulations for the  championship in one of the largest changes in its seventy-year history. The pandemic prompted these changes to be postponed until , with teams required to enter their  cars in the 2021 championship to minimise the financial stress placed on the teams. The sport had also planned to introduce a $175 million budget cap in 2021, which was later revised to $150 million. Teams called for further revisions to $100 million, arguing that the pandemic threatened the future of four of the ten teams.\n\nIn March 2020, some Formula One drivers entered virtual versions of several races dubbed \"Not The GP\". The races were hosted by Jean-\u00c9ric Vergne's Veloce Esports, in partnership with Formula One. The online races were contested by current and former Formula One drivers, like Lando Norris, Nicholas Latifi, Stoffel Vandoorne, Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez, Emerson Fittipaldi, Nico H\u00fclkenberg, Johnny Herbert and Martin Brundle, as well as celebrities and other sportsmen; Norris in particular, alongside Alex Albon, George Russell, and Charles Leclerc, would spend most of the offseason livestreaming on Twitch. On 29 June 2020, ahead of the season opening race in Austria, McLaren took a loan of \u00a3150m from the National Bank of Bahrain to mitigate the effect of coronavirus on the company.\n\nThe first few races of the rescheduled 2020 season, included the Austrian, Styrian, Hungarian and two Grands Prix at Silverstone, which all took place in \"bio-secure\" conditions behind closed doors.\n\nA day prior to the British Grand Prix, Racing Point driver Sergio P\u00e9rez was confirmed to have tested positive for the virus following an inconclusive result earlier in the day, ruling him out of the race. Nico H\u00fclkenberg was announced as his replacement for that race, and as well as the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix the following weekend.\n\nWilliams was sold to Dorilton Capital due to financial pressures, ending family ownership of and involvement with the team.\n\nRacing Point driver Lance Stroll missed the Eifel Grand Prix after falling ill, which was later diagnosed as COVID-19. He was replaced by H\u00fclkenberg. Lawrence Stroll, owner of the Racing Point team and father of Lance, also tested positive.\n\nOn 30 November 2020, a day after winning the Bahrain Grand Prix, Drivers' Champion Lewis Hamilton announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19, claiming to have been experiencing \"mild symptoms\". During the week leading to the race, he underwent three tests, but all returned negative. Mercedes confirmed that Hamilton would miss the Sakhir Grand Prix in Bahrain later that week as a result. He was replaced by George Russell from Williams who was in turn replaced by Jack Aitken.\n\n2021 \nPrior to the beginning of the 2021 season, three more drivers \u2013 Norris, Charles Leclerc and Pierre Gasly \u2013 and Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff all tested positive for COVID-19 in separate occasions. On the eve of pre-season testing at Bahrain, Alfa Romeo team principal Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vasseur tested positive for COVID-19, hence unable to accompany the team for testing. Prior to the British Grand Prix, McLaren team principal Zak Brown tested positive.\n\nIn January 2021, more changes were made to the 2021 Formula One World Championship, with the 2021 Australian Grand Prix being postponed from 21 March all the way to 21 November. However, the event was eventually cancelled on 6 July 2021 for the second year in a row due to Australia's strict quarantine protocols and travel restrictions to the state of Victoria, where it is held. The race was replaced with the inaugural Qatar Grand Prix. The Chinese Grand Prix was postponed for the second year in a row, and was later eventually cancelled. The event was originally supposed to run on 11 April.\n\nIn response to this, two GPs would have to fill in the vacancies and F1 chose to run the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix on 18 April and the Portuguese Grand Prix on 2 May. These were announced in January and February 2021 respectively, just before the season started.\n\nFurther with cancellations, the Canadian Grand Prix was cancelled for the second year running and was replaced by the Turkish Grand Prix. The original date for the GP was 13 June. A month later on 14 May, the Turkish Grand Prix was postponed due to travel restrictions, before being reinstated onto the calendar after the Singapore Grand Prix was subsequently cancelled for another year in a row. The schedule was changed so that the 2021 French Grand Prix would be moved up a week from 27 June to 20 June, and that the Styrian Grand Prix would take its original slot. The Austrian Grand Prix took place on its original date of 4 July. The Japanese Grand Prix was then announced to be cancelled for a second year in a row on August 18.\n\nFormula 2 and Formula 3\nThe Bahrain and Barcelona rounds of the FIA Formula 2 and Formula 3 Championships\u2014a series of races for junior drivers that run in support of Formula 1 events\u2014were postponed when the Bahrain and Spanish Grands Prix were postponed. The Monaco and Zandvoort Formula 2 rounds were cancelled when the Monaco and Dutch Grands Prix were cancelled and the Baku round cancelled when the Azerbaijan Grand Prix was cancelled. The Yas Marina round, which was scheduled to support Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was cancelled due to maximum slot for the calendar as an impact of the pandemic. Formula 3 had not been scheduled to race in Monaco or Azerbaijan, but the Dutch round was also cancelled, along with Russia and Bahrain due to maximum slot for the calendar as an impact of the pandemic.\n\nFormula E\nThe Formula E championship for electric cars initially responded to the pandemic by postponing the Rome and Sanya ePrix. Planned races in Paris, Jakarta and Seoul were also postponed, prompting organisers to postpone the entire season by two months.\n\nOn 17 June it was announced that the series would finish at the Tempelhof Airport Street Circuit with three double headers on three different layouts in August, and that the races in Rome, Sanya, Paris, Jakarta, Seoul, New York and London have been cancelled.\n\nGT World Challenge Europe\nThe 3 Hours of Monza round of the 2020 GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup, scheduled for 19 April, was cancelled.\n\nIndyCar\nIn wake of the Rudy Gobert and NBA situation, the IndyCar Series initially announced on 12 March that it would hold the Grand Prix of St. Petersburg \u2014 the opening race of the 2020 season \u2014 behind closed doors. On 13 March in respect of the NBA suspension, the series announced that it would cancel all races through at least the end of April, including St. Petersburg, Alabama, Long Beach, and Austin. IndyCar intended to begin the season with the traditional \"Month of May\" races at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, including the GMR Grand Prix (held on IMS's road course configuration), and the 104th running of the Indianapolis 500 on its traditional Memorial Day Sunday date. IndyCar formed the IndyCar iRacing Challenge, with its drivers racing against one another on the iRacing racing simulation game.\n\nOn 26 March, IndyCar announced that it would postpone the two Indianapolis races to later in the season\u2014moving the GMR Grand Prix to the Fourth of July as support for the NASCAR Cup Series' Brickyard 400 (and creating a rare NASCAR\/IndyCar double-header with the Xfinity Series' Pennzoil 150), and the 500 to 23 August\u2014marking the first time in history that it has not been held in May. Therefore, the season was to tentatively begin with the Detroit Grand Prix. The Grand Prix of St. Petersburg was reinstated as the planned season finale, with a date to be determined. On 6 April, IndyCar announced that the Detroit Grand Prix had been canceled. To make up for other canceled races, it was announced that a third race at Indianapolis (the IndyCar Harvest GP, a second race on the track's road course) would be added to the schedule in October, and that the Iowa 300 and Monterey Grand Prix would become twin race weekends with two points-paying races each.\n\nOn 7 May, IndyCar officially announced that the season would begin 6 June with the Genesys 300 at Texas Motor Speedway, with races held with limited spectators (only those that owned units in the Turn 2 Lone Star Tower were allowed to attend the race, a practice that began at the NASCAR weekend in Charlotte that is also owned by Sonic Automotive) and with enhanced safety protocols until further notice. To accommodate same-day qualifying and practice, the race was shortened from its usual 248-lap (600 kilometer) distance to 200 laps (300 miles). Although circuit president Eddie Gossage originally insisted that he would not allow the race to be held unless as support for a NASCAR event (the postponed March NASCAR tripleheader was rescheduled for July), he later came to terms with new series owner Roger Penske.  The NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series race scheduled after the originally scheduled Friday qualifying of the INDYCAR weekend was postponed to October 25, becoming part of the Cup Series Texas 500 race day and allowing spectators. On 21 May, IndyCar announced the cancellation of the Honda Indy Toronto and Indy Richmond 300 events due to local restrictions, and that the REV Group Grand Prix at Road America would become a twin-race weekend and assume Toronto's date on the schedule.\n\nOn 1 June, IndyCar announced that the 2020 season of its developmental Indy Lights circuit had been scrapped because of logistics and a lack of entries. On 8 June, Penske stated his preference for the Indianapolis 500 to not be held behind closed doors, and that he would be willing to delay the event to October if state restrictions are not sufficiently loosened by August. On 26 June, IndyCar and IMS announced that the 500 would be held with spectators, limited to half of its normal capacity.  This was later changed to 25 percent capacity, then to behind closed doors in a final announcement on 4 August.  By September, the Speedway announced there would be up to 10,000 tickets available for spectators for the third series meeting, the Harvest Classic, seated in the grandstands in the Snake Pit section and Turn 1 of the road course.\n\nFor 2021, IndyCar moved street races again because of the pandemic, and a related date change was also made because of it.  The St. Petersburg race was moved from 7 March to 25 April and the Grand Prix of Long Beach from 18 April to 26 September because of, respectively, attendance restrictions and a stay-at-home order.  The Grand Prix of Alabama at Barber Motorsports Park, originally set for 25 April, was announced as the new season opener on 11 April.  With Long Beach moved, INDYCAR and NBC Sports moved that round back a week to 18 April, to avoid the season opener from being up against the final round of golf's Masters Tournament that is held in Augusta, Georgia, which is 375\u00a0km east of Leeds, Alabama via Interstate 20.\n\nOn 14 May, the Honda Indy Toronto was cancelled by officials.  IndyCar intended to replace this race, but for the premiership NTT IndyCar Series ended up not doing so; therefore, the series now has a four-week break planned from the beginning of July to the beginning of August.  The Road to Indy support races as part of the Honda Indy Toronto were moved to Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course in October as its own standalone date.\n\nOn 21 April, it was announced that the 2021 Indianapolis 500 would be capped at 135,000 fans, or roughly 40% capacity. The sold-out event became the largest sporting event since the Pandemic had begun in March, 2020.\n\nMotoGP\n\nCancelled races\n\nThe MotoGP World Championship cancelled the opening round of the 2020 championship in Qatar. The Moto2 and Moto3 support categories raced in the country, as the teams were already in Qatar for their final preseason test before the quarantine measures were put in place. Planned events in Thailand, the United States, and Argentina were also postponed, but were initially  rescheduled to 4 October, 15 and 22 November respectively (The United States round was cancelled entirely on 8 July). The races at Jerez, Le Mans, and Catalunya were also postponed, but later rescheduled to 19 July (with a second round to be held on 26 July), 27 September, and 11 October respectively, while the Mugello, Sachensring, Assen, Silverstone, Phillip Island, Motegi, Kymi Ring, Termas de Rio Hondo, Circuit of The Americas, Sepang, and Buriram rounds were removed.\n\nRescheduled calendar\nThe pandemic forced the calendar to be rescheduled. On 11 June, the season is to contain 5 \"double-headers\" on consecutive weekends at Jerez (with the second round under the name of Andalusian Grand Prix), Austria (with the second round under the name of Styrian Grand Prix), Misano (with the second round under the name of Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix), Aragon (with the second round under the name of Teruel Grand Prix), and Valencia (with the first round under the name of European Grand Prix and revived since 1995) to achieve a minimum of 13 races. On 10 August, the season finale would see the return of the Portuguese Grand Prix since 2012 at the Algarve International Circuit, making the Valencia round, which had been the season finale since 2002, the penultimate round for the 2020 season.\n\nInfected riders\nThere were 4 riders that missed races due to testing positive for the virus or coming into close contact with individuals who were infected by the virus. In mid-September, Moto2 rider Jorge Mart\u00edn missed both Misano rounds, becoming the first rider in all classes who to test positive for the virus. For the second Misano round he was replaced by Mattia Pasini. In mid-October, Valentino Rossi missed both Aragon rounds due to testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, becoming the first premier class rider to test positive. His team decided not to field a replacement for him before the Teruel round, deciding to only field his teammate, Maverick Vi\u00f1ales. As Rossi missed the race (along with defending champion Marc M\u00e1rquez who was absent since the Andalusian Grand Prix due to his crash at the previous round), the first Aragon race marked the first time since 1999 at Rio de Janeiro when no current or former premier class Champion lined up on the grid. In the Moto3 class at the same venue, Tony Arbolino, despite testing negative for COVID-19, was forced to miss the Aragon Grand Prix as he had come into close contact with an infected passenger on his flight after the French Grand Prix and was required to self-isolate as a result. He was not replaced for that event and was back to racing at the Teruel Grand Prix. In early November, three days before the European Grand Prix at Valencia, Tech3 rider Iker Lecuona was forced to sit out of the race, due to Andorran quarantine rules for close contact with individuals who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. His brother \u2013 with whom he lived in Andorra \u2013 and his personal assistant both tested positive for the virus on 3 November, meaning Lecuona was forced into a mandatory quarantine of 10 days minimum. Tech3 elected not to replace him on such short notice. Lecuona also missed the Valencian Grand Prix after he subsequently tested positive for the virus shortly before the beginning of the race weekend, and subsequently the Portuguese Grand Prix on the following weekend. KTM factory test rider Mika Kallio replaced Lecuona in Portugal. Lecuona became the second premier class rider who has missed races because of isolation.\n\nAMA Supercross Championship\nThe Monster Energy AMA Supercross Series postponed its scheduled race card at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis just before it was to occur on 14 March.  On 25 March, officials announced the postponement of six more events.  The cards \u2013 consisting of the 450cc class and one of two 250cc classes each \u2013 were rescheduled for seven consecutive dates between 31 May and 21 June.  All of them occurred behind closed doors at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nThe Supercross All Star event, Monster Energy Cup, was scheduled for 10 October at Dignity Health Sports Park for the first time in history after being in Las Vegas at Sam Boyd Stadium for the first 9 year of the event. It was removed on 30 July because there was not enough time between the outdoor motocross nationals and the event for rides to rest and train for the event.\n\nThe 2021 Supercross schedule was announced in December 2020, and in keeping with continued ramifications of the pandemic, nearly the entire schedule was held in just six locations.  Each stop, except for Salt Lake City, featured three races (Salt Lake City only had two races).  Of the five areas, four had a split Saturday-Tuesday-Saturday schedule (Houston, Indianapolis, Arlington, Hampton).  The fifth area with a stop, Central Florida, featured two consecutive Saturdays with races in Orlando before a week off to be followed by the Daytona Beach stop (which is promoted by NASCAR, not Feld Entertainment).  Atlanta Motor Speedway became the fourth different Atlanta metropolitan venue to host Supercross.  For the first time since Supercross began, no races were held in California.\n\nThe Lucas Oil Pro Motocross Championship original schedule for 2020 contested of 12 rounds starting in late May and ending in late August. The number of events was reduced to nine rounds at seven venues.  The Loretta Lynn's Amateur Championship was added as a result of the pandemic, with two rounds of professional motocross at the said event, and Red Bud MX also had 2 rounds of racing due to the pandemic.\n\nNASCAR Holdings\n\nNASCAR National Series\n\n2020 season\nIn the wake of the Rudy Gobert and NBA situation on the Wednesday of the 2020 Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 week that was scheduled to be held starting Friday, part of the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series, NASCAR announced that the events would be held behind closed doors; this event, along with the Dixie Vodka 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway, were later postponed in respect of the NBA. On 16 March, NASCAR announced that all race events through 3 May were postponed, however they still intend to run all 36 races for the season. On 17 April, NASCAR announced that it had postponed the Blue-Emu Maximum Pain Relief 500 (9 May at Martinsville Speedway), but that they still intend to run a full schedule of 36 races. NASCAR began to organize invitational eSports events on iRacing, the eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series.\n\nOn 30 April 2020, NASCAR announced that it would resume races in a modified schedule, with seven events across its three national series (including two Cup Series doubleheaders, and Xfinity Series and Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series events) at Darlington Raceway and Charlotte Motor Speedway from 17 to 27 May. NASCAR stated that it still planned to run its full schedule of races, but that where events would be held beyond these May races was subject to change, with a tentative plan to focus primarily on \"classic\" tracks in the Southeastern United States (within driving distance of Charlotte\u2014where the majority of NASCAR staff and teams are based). NASCAR announced the next set of races on 14 May (through late-June), formally cancelling originally-scheduled races in late-May and early-June, and shifting postponed or rescheduled events in their place at Bristol Motor Speedway (Bristol, Tennessee), Atlanta Motor Speedway, Martinsville, Homestead-Miami, and Talladega Superspeedway. On 2 June, NASCAR announced the third phase of the revised schedule through early-August, including a mid-week NASCAR All-Star Race on 15 July at Bristol (as part of a double-header with the NASCAR-owned ARCA Menards Series), and a Thursday race at Kansas Speedway.\n\nThe Cup Series returned with the 56th running, and first since November 2004, of The Real Heroes 400 on 17 May (in support of The Real Heroes Project\u2014a collaboration of U.S. sports leagues honoring front line health care workers), followed by a rare Wednesday-night race (the first since the 1984 Firecracker 400), the Toyota 500 (km) on 20 May (the first scheduled 300-mile Cup Series race since 1963 at the circuit). The Xfinity Series returned on 19 May with the Toyota 200, while all three series raced their regularly-scheduled Memorial Day weekend events at Charlotte Motor Speedway. In the Cup Series, this included two events \u2014 the 61st running of the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday, and the 500 kilometer Alsco Uniforms 500 on the following Wednesday.\n\nThe first wave of races was held mostly behind closed doors with only essential staff present and team sizes capped at 16, physical distancing requirements for garages and spotters, additional protective equipment for drivers and pit crew members, random temperature checks and removal of symptomatic team members, and requiring teams to perform contact tracing logs. Charlotte and Atlanta opened the races to frontstretch condominium owners, who could each offer five guests.  To reduce on-track activity, all events are being held without qualifying or practice sessions (excluding the Coca-Cola 600, which used same-day qualifying, and the Pennzoil 150 Xfinity race, which had Friday practice as the Indianapolis Motor Speedway moved the event to the road course as part of an INDYCAR doubleheader), and starting order was initially determined by either a random draw, divided into segments of the owners' points standings as of that race, for single race meetings, and for the second race in the same meeting, the finishing order from the previous race with the top 20 inverted. Similar to rules used when rain cleaned the rubber off the circuit between the last session and the race, refueling of cars was prohibited until a predetermined safety car situation (\"competition caution\") at a specific lap (between lap 10 on road courses to lap 50 on short tracks) announced during the conference call that drivers, crew chiefs, and officials participated during the week that replaced the competitors' meeting held on race morning.  Some Truck Series races did not use them because of their shorter lengths.  The safety car situation was used in order to allow for extended adjustments of vehicles.  If a safety car is called before the predetermined lap, refueling was still prohibited until the predetermined lap safety car, unless NASCAR determines they are within enough laps to allow for the rule to be cleared.\n\nStarting in August with the Daytona road course round, NASCAR launched a new procedure based on performance.  The new procedure is a three-pronged, weighted system formula taking into account the team owners' current place in the points standings, drivers' previous race finish, and drivers' fastest lap in the previous race.  The driver with the lowest total number is awarded the pole, the second-lowest starts on the outside of the front row, and so on.\n\nAfter four weeks, and six races had been conducted with only the Charlotte and Atlanta races having limited spectators in condominiums on the circuit, NASCAR announced on 9 June that invited guests will be admitted at the Dixie Vodka 400 in Homestead.  Homestead featured 1,000 members of the U.S. military from the South Florida area (representing United States Southern Command and the Homestead Air Reserve Base).  The GEICO 500 at Talladega was the first round to feature paid spectators, with a limit of 5,000 spectators combined in the grandstands and backstretch camping, featuring priority to local ticketholders.  The ARCA Menards Series General Tire 200 and NASCAR Xfinity Series Unhinged 300 support races were the first to admit paying spectators, as backstretch campers were allowed to stage on track to watch all three races.  NASCAR procedure would be only Cup Series races would have grandstands open, while support series races would have selected camping areas (initially outside the circuit overlooking the circuit, but later adjusted at some races to allow selected infield campgrounds) open.\n\nOn 3 July, Jimmie Johnson reported that he had tested positive for COVID-19 (the first NASCAR driver to do so), requiring him to use Justin Allgaier as a substitute driver for that weekend's Big Machine Hand Sanitizer 400.  That turned out to be crucial, as Johnson, who had been scheduled to start sixth, would miss the playoff cut by six points. Johnson was asymptomatic, and was cleared on 8 July after two further tests came back negative.  On 15 August, Austin Dillon became the second Cup Series driver to reveal a positive test, and as a result he missed the Daytona Grand Prix.  Unlike Johnson, Dillon had already secured a playoff spot by winning the O'Reilly Auto Parts 500 at Texas the month before.\n\nOn 8 July, NASCAR announced the remaining schedule of races through the end of the regular season in late-August, including twin races at Dover International Speedway and Michigan International Speedway (both held on their regularly scheduled dates, but with a Saturday rescheduled race each) that would both be 500-kilometer races, and the race at Watkins Glen International being replaced by inaugural road course races at Daytona due to New York state travel restrictions. NASCAR stated that more upcoming races may be held with spectators on a case-by-case basis depending on local health orders, with Texas Motor Speedway (50% capacity for Cup only in grandstands, backstretch camping open for all races), New Hampshire Motor Speedway (19,000), and both Daytona races (about 20,000 for Cup only, some infield camping was allowed) planning to do so.  Of these races, Kansas, Dover, and Michigan were held behind closed doors.  The 2020 NASCAR All-Star Race was held at Bristol Motor Speedway on 15 July instead of in Charlotte so that it could host limited spectators. Twenty-two thousand spectators attended of a potential 30,000, or approximately 20% of the venue's total capacity of 162,000, seats available.  It was the largest number of spectators at any U.S. sporting event since the beginning of pandemic restrictions.\n\nOn 6 August, NASCAR filled out the rest of its 2020 season.  The schedule for the playoffs in the Cup Series saw no change in the order of races or the tracks on which they ran.  With two races still to be made up because of previous cancellations, the Xfinity Series playoff opener was delayed one week, starting with the Alsco 300 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.  A second race was added at Talladega, the Ag-Pro 300, which was in the playoff.  The truck series playoff schedule included the rescheduled INDYCAR weekend race at Texas Motor Speedway (Texas and INDYCAR agreed to remove all support races for that weekend, which was held on its regularly scheduled weekend) and a third race at Kansas Speedway.  The first two races were to be at World Wide Technology Raceway at Gateway (which kept its date, like Texas part of the INDYCAR weekend and logistics made it part of the regular season) and Canadian Tire Motorsports Park (removed because of travel restrictions by the Canadian government;  the same restrictions forced Canadian-based MLB, NBA, and MLS teams to move their games to the United States for the season and part of next season as well, along with all Canadian National Hockey League teams were put in one division for the 2021 season, as well as cancelling the INDYCAR race in Toronto)  Changes to the regular season include a second Xfinity Series race at Richmond Raceway (had been originally removed for a Martinsville Speedway race) and the Truck Series returned to Darlington for the first time since 2011, while Richmond, which had originally been set for the cancelled April Cup meeting, was moved to the September race meeting.\n\nDuring the playoffs, tickets were available for the races at Darlington (8,000 spectators;  first meeting of two Cup races behind closed doors), Bristol (hosted about 20,000 spectators of possible 30,000 at non-championship meeting;  first championship meeting behind closed doors), Charlotte (7,500 seats), Kansas (8,400 seats), Talladega (which hosted 5,000 in the June meeting), Texas (about 50% capacity, or 50,000 seats; hosted July meeting with spectators), Martinsville (1,000, first meeting was behind closed doors), and Phoenix (about 20% capacity, or 8,400 seats).  The Richmond and Las Vegas races were behind closed doors; the first date at the latter track was held before the pandemic, and only began admitting spectators for the relocated NHRA World Finals at its drag strip from 30 October to 1 November.  Bristol announced a legal sellout of its 30,000 available seats on 9 September, ten days before the scheduled race date.  Charlotte also had oversold tickets and has a legal sellout.  Initially, all support races were held behind closed doors, but Bristol and Charlotte allowed spectators for their Xfinity races, and Texas allowed spectators for the Truck race as it was the undercard on the same day as the Cup race.  All support races permitted spectators by October, as Texas, Talladega, and Kansas allowed spectators in recreational vehicles parked in lots overlooking the track or some infield sections for camping access to races where grandstands were closed.\n\n2021 season\nNASCAR announced the 2021 Cup Series schedule on 30 September, the 2021 Xfinity Series schedule on 30 October, and the 2021 Camping World Truck series schedule on 19 November.  Some of its race dates were originally introduced during the pandemic, specifically the spring meeting at Darlington for all three top series (which actually flipped lineages as Darlington moved the September race lineage back to the spring, and vice versa).  The Talladega playoff race was added for the second consecutive year for the Xfinity Series (it was removed at the end of the 2022 season).  Also, NASCAR kept pandemic restrictions in place by announcing only eight weekends would feature a full slate of practice and qualifying, which were the Daytona 500, Coca-Cola 600, the five weekends on new circuits or changed layouts (the March Bristol meeting, on dirt, Austin, Nashville, Road America, Indianapolis on the road course), and the November Phoenix championship round.  All other meetings would use the pandemic format of no practice or qualifying with grids set by the competition formula implemented starting with the first August Daytona round.  When the Bristol spring meeting qualifying was cancelled, NASCAR used the competition formula to determine the starting order, a permanent change from the traditional use of owner points.\n\nThe Daytona meeting carried a limit of about 30,000 of estimated 101,500 grandstand seats offered to spectators. On 8 December 2020, it was announced that Auto Club Speedway in California will not host a race for the Cup and Xfinity series in 2021 due to increasing California state restrictions, and will be replaced by the Daytona Grand Prix which will swap dates with the Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway race for logistics reasons. All three national series will race at the Daytona Road Course, with the Truck Series race at Homestead replaced with the Daytona Road Course.  The Cup race will expand from 235 miles to 400\u00a0km, while the Xfinity (300\u00a0km) and Truck (250\u00a0km) races will keep their distances from 2020.\n\nBy May, circuits began removing attendance restrictions.  The 62nd Annual Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway will be the first circuit to allow a full allotment of spectators.  Most circuits than announced grandstands would be fully open to spectators, with NASCAR announcing on 2 June 2021 the last of the circuits still restricted would be fully open, ending NASCAR's pandemic restrictions in grandstands.\n\nOn 15 May 2021, in the wake of INDYCAR and Formula One cancelling rounds in Canada, Fox Sports writer Bob Pockrass sent a Twitter message saying Camping World Truck Series teams were being prepared in case Canadian Tire Motorsport Park (Mosport), in Bowmanville, Ontario, would have to be cancelled because of Canadian restrictions.

{"eng_Latn":"Wang Mantang (\u738b\u6ee1\u5802; 1471 \u2013 1541), was a renowned beauty from Bazhou and a unofficial consort of the Zhengde Emperor. She is known for being called the Washing Clothes Empress (\u6d63\u8863\u7687\u540e).\n\nBiography\nDespite the strict restrictions placed on women during the Ming dynasty, Wang Mantang's behavior was rebellious and was encouraged by her father. Her father was a writer for court judges and had several connections around town. When Wang Mantang grew up, she was known for her beauty and uniqueness.\n\nThe Zhengde Emperor liked to frequent brothels and created palaces called \"Bao Fang\" (\u8c79\u623f) outside the Imperial Palace for exotic animals such as tigers and leopards. He later used these palaces to house women, and as a result, searched for beautiful women. Wang Mantang wanted an opportunity to be his consort and went to the imperial selection. However, her young age and inexperience led to her not being selected to serve the emperor. Wang Mantang returned to home to the disappointment of her parents.\n\nOne day, she had a dream about becoming empress. Her father believed this as fate, and he told a monk about Wang Mantang's dream. The monk told his friend Duan Chang (\u6bb5\ud872\udf2e) about her prediction, and he believed it. Duan Chang had ambitions of becoming the emperor and faked his identity by using a prosperous name. Duan Chang approached Wang Mantang's father, who was delighted. Wang Mantang and Duan Chang soon married, and it was only after marriage that Wang Mantang's parents found out Duan Chang was in fact, a poor villager. Duan Chang spread the news that he was married to a future empress and the local villagers gathered around them for blessings.\n\nThe emperor heard of this incident, and he told his general to figure out who was causing the commotion. The general predicted a rebellion, but instead discovered Duan Chang wearing the emperor's robes. The emperor enslaved Wang Mantang and her husband. Along the way to the Inner City, the emperor took interest of Wang Mantang. He was going to let her reside in a Bao Fang, but she was thrown into the Imperial Palace's washing department. They later reunited and the emperor promised to make her empress and replace Empress Xia. He never achieved this promise since he soon died as a result of drowning. His successor, the Jiajing Emperor gave the Zhengde Emperor's consorts the title of consort dowagers. Since Wang Mantang didn't receive a title, she was forced to return to the washing department and was known by other palace maids as the Washing Clothes Empress.\n\nReferences\n\n16th-century Chinese women\n16th-century Chinese people\nChinese ladies-in-waiting\nMing dynasty imperial consorts\nPeople from Bazhou, Hebei\nPeople from Langfang"}
{"eng_Latn":"\nBunji (Urdu:\u0628\u0646\u062c\u06cc) (Balti: \u0628\u0646\u062c\u06cc) is a town in Astore District, Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. it is historically important being in the end of Dogra rule before 1948 and on the edge of ancient Yagistan. It was economically hub for barter trade between Yagistan and Dogras. The distance from Bunji to Gilgit is about  on the Karakoram Highway. Bunji, located at the junction of Three Great Mountain Ranges, has its historical importance. The village has its prominent traces in the socio-political and economical situations of the region in History. Literacy rate of bunji is almost 100 percent except outsider coming from other places for jobs. River Indus covers the village from North to west while from eastern side it is connected with river Astore. Baltistan region joins its territory from the North-East.\n\nEtymology \nThe town was earlier known as Bawanji. By the 20th century, the name had been shortened to Bunji.\n\nHistory \n\nBunji is in the Astor principality, which came under the control of Skardu (Baltistan) during the rule of Ali Sher Khan Anchan ().\n\nThe 19th century geographer Frederic Drew states that Bunji had significant agriculture and horticulture at this time. But it was laid \"waste\" during the invasions of Sulaiman Shah (ruler of Yasin, \u20131825), after which only a small area was cultivated.\n\nGeneral Zorawar Singh, the governor of Kishtwar under Raja Gulab Singh, conquered Skardu in 1840, and sent his forces to occupy Rondu and Astor. Raja Jabbar Khan of Astor eventually surrendered and he was sent to Zorawar Singh. However, the Sikh governor of Kashmir, Ghulam Mohiuddin, contested Zorawar Singh's claim, and retrieved control of Astor and reinstated Jabbar Khan as his subsidiary.\n\nAfter the Dogras established the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir under British suzerainty (1846), the Dogras built a fort at Bunji and stationed troops there. Bunji was regarded as a strategic point on the road from Srinagar to Gilgit. In the early years of Dogra rule, Gilgit was repeatedly invaded by Raja Gauhar Rehman of Punial and Bunji troops became involved in the conflicts. The frontier states were subdued only after the British established the Gilgit Agency in 1889.\n\nUntil 1935, Bunji was part of the Astore tehsil of the Gilgit wazarat. After that date, the British leased the Gilgit tehsil to the north of Indus as the Gilgit leased area, and Astore became an independent wazarat administered as part of the Kashmir province of the state.\n\nShortly before the partition of India in 1947, the British transferred the Gilgit Agency to the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. The 6th battalion of Jammu and Kashmir State Forces was sent to Bunji to support the Gilgit Agency (which had its own forces in the form of the Gilgit Scouts). The Muslim troops of the state force battalion, under the leadership of Mirza Hassan Khan, joined the rebellion raised by the Gilgit Scouts on 1 November 1947. Subsequently Bunji was attacked by the Gilgit Scouts and all the non-Muslims of the battalion were taken prisoner. Some of the non-Muslim forces escaped to Skardu where they held out till August 1948.\n\nGeography\n\nClimate \nBunji has a cool arid climate (K\u00f6ppen BWk), typical for Gilgit-Baltistan valleys though hotter than almost all other such localities.\n\nThe annual temperature averages . In a year, the average rainfall is . The hottest month is July and January is the coldest month of the year in Bunji. The driest month is November with  of precipitation. In May, precipitation reaches its highest peak at an average of .\n\nTourism \nBunji is a tourist destination in Pakistan. The main attractions are the historic Bunji Mess and the Bunji Bridge.\n\nBunji Hydropower Project \nBHPP is a sub project of Pakistan with a planned capacity of 7100 MW, if constructed. Currently, this project is undergoing a feasibility study and detailed design. The companies conducting the feasibility and detailed design studies are involved in a joint venture, consisted of Mott MacDonald UK, Mott MacDonald Pakistan, Sogreah Consultants (France), Nippon Koei (Japan) and Development & Management consultants (Pakistan). This joint venture is known as Bunji Consultants Joint Venture (BCJV).\n\nThe dam site area is located  from Gilgit on Skardu road near Asmani Mor. The proposed powerhouse is located in the Bunji village.\n\nSee also \n\n Karakoram Highway\n Gorikot\n\nReferences\n\nWorks cited\n \n \n \n \n\nPopulated places in Astore District\nCities in Pakistan"}

With a length of  in the north\u2013south direction and a maximum width of , Ouiatchouane Lake turns out to be a bulge of the Ouiatchouan River. It receives its water through the channel located to the southwest which connects it to lac Bouchette. End to end, these two twinned lakes form a body of water  long. A narrow 0.5\u00a0km isthmus which is crossed on the west side by a channel of about 250 m long designated the \"Pass\", separates the lakes Bouchette and Ouiatchouane. The Hermitage road crosses this isthmus from East to West, towards the Ermitage Saint-Antoine located west of the lake, near the Ouiatchouan River.\n\nThe waters supplying Lake Ouiatchouan come from Lac des Commissaires, which flows into the Rivi\u00e8re des Commissaires which flows for 3\u00a0km north-east at the limit of ranges V1 and V11. The plans of the Mapping Service of the Ministry of Energy and Resources of the Government of Quebec indicate this segment of the river as the Ouiatchouan River.

This river flows 28\u00a0km north to reach Lac Saint-Jean, 6.5\u00a0km northwest of the intersection of route 155 and route 169. The Ouiatchouan river flows mainly in the woods, except the last two kilometres of its route which are agricultural in nature.\n\nRoute 155 and Railway\n\nThe route 155, connecting La Tuque and Chambord (Lac Saint-Jean), runs along the eastern part of lakes Bouchette and Ouiatchouan. This road crosses the village of Lac-Bouchette, which is located on the east shore of these two lakes. The path to Lake Ouiatchouan bypasses North Lake Yesatchouan.

{"eng_Latn":"Paul D'Amato (born c. 1948) is an American actor.\n\nEarly life, education, and career\nBorn in Worcester, Massachusetts, D'Amato began working as a stage hand at the age of 14, and decided at the age of 21 that he wanted to become an actor. He attended Emerson College, where he appeared in school productions and also played on the school ice hockey team. In 1974, he moved to Montpelier, Vermont, and acted in a local theatre ensemble. He was well-reviewed as one of the three prisoners in a 1975 stage production of the Jean Genet play, Deathwatch.\n\nFilm career\nD'Amato's combination of acting experience and ice hockey experience put him in contention for a role in the 1977 film Slap Shot, in which he ultimately wound up appearing as a main antagonist. He thereafter appeared in films including The Deadliest Season (1977 TV film), The Deer Hunter (1978), Firepower (1979), and Heaven's Gate. His appearance in Slap Shot served as the basis of artist John Byrne's rendition of the comic book character, Wolverine. D'Amato also had a stage career, appearing in a Vermont production of Shakespeare's Pericles, Prince of Tyre in 1980. In the 1980s, D'Amato was typically cast as a thug or henchman; in a 1983 pilot for the TV series Murder Ink, his character assaulted a character played by Ellen Barkin, and in the 1987 film Suspect, he \"held a razor to Cher's throat... and stabbed [Dennis Quaid]\". In the 1990s and 2000s' D'Amato appeared as different characters in multiple episodes of Law & Order and Law & Order: Criminal Intent.\n\nLater life\nD'Amato continued to make public appearances in the 2010s, mostly evoking his appearance in Slap Shot. In November 2010, D'Amato dropped the ceremonial first puck at a hockey game between the Danbury Whalers and the Broome County Barons. In July 2012, he came out for an ice skating event to raise funds for Hope Lodge in Worcester. In August 2017, he participated in a reunion of members of the Slap Shot cast in Winnipeg for a golf tournament commemorating the 40th anniversary of the film. By 2019, he was working as a boot-fitter in a Vermont ski shop, which facilitated his own skiing hobby.\n\nPersonal life\nIn the mid-1970s, D'Amato married Bertine Colombo of Montpelier, who he met while they attended adjacent colleges. In 2019, he was engaged to Marina Re.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Matt Shields, \"Talking With Dr. Hook From 'Slap Shot'\", Bleacher Report (April 25, 2007)\n\n1940s births\nLiving people\nActors from Worcester, Massachusetts\nEmerson College alumni\nAmerican actors"}

{"eng_Latn":"The Arthur Ashe Monument is a bronze sculpture by Paul DiPasquale installed along Richmond, Virginia's Monument Avenue. The statue depicts tennis player Arthur Ashe, who was born, raised and buried in Richmond.\n\nDescription\nThe statue is situated on a 16-foot granite pedestal on a traffic island, at the intersection of Monument Avenue and Roseneath Road. The 12-foot tall bronze sculpture depicts Arthur Ashe holding a tennis racket in one hand and books in the other, surrounded by children. The books are raised higher than the tennis racket; this was requested by Ashe himself, as he tended to emphasize education over sports. Ashe's depiction faces west and the children face east.\n\nBackground\n\nArthur Ashe\nAshe was born at Richmond's St. Philip Hospital for Negroes on March 10, 1943. During his childhood, Richmond was segregated, and he was denied entry to tennis tournaments and was not allowed to practice on the city's best courts. In 1960, Ashe moved to St. Louis to attend Sumner High School. In the following years, Ashe would become the first player selected to the United States Davis Cup team (1981), and was the only black man to win the singles title at the US Open (1968), the Australian Open (1975), and Wimbledon (1975) tennis tournaments. He retired in April 1980. Following his death of AIDS-related pneumonia on February 6, 1993, Ashe's body laid in state at Virginia's Executive Mansion, located in Richmond.\n\nMonument Avenue\nAt the time of the statue's construction, Monument Avenue had statues of several Generals of the Confederate States Army, as well as Confederate States Navy Commander Matthew Fontaine Maury and Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Among tallest were the Robert E. Lee Monument, which stood 21 feet tall atop a 40-foot pedestal, and the Davis Memorial, which sat on a 65-foot column. The monuments, constructed from 1890 to 1929, were likely influenced by the then-popular belief that the Confederacy was just and heroic, an ideology also referred to as the Lost Cause of the Confederacy.\n\nHistory \nDiPasquale met Ashe in 1992, and received permission to design a statue of him. Nine crayon and pencil studies of Ashe were created before his death in 1993. Following his death, Ashe's widow Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe approved the studies, and recommended Virginia Heroes Incorporated for funding. The designs were first unveiled, in plaster form, in December 1994 at the Ashe Center.\n\nWith the urging of City Manager Robert Bobb, Richmond City Council approved the placement of the statue on Monument Avenue in June 1995. This decision was met with opposition by both black and white people, both objecting to its placement beside statues of Confederate generals.  One alternative location, supported by Mayor Leonidas B. Young II, was in the formerly whites-only Byrd Park.\n\nOn July 17, city council held an eight hour long hearing on the location of the statue, eventually voting 7-0 in favor of the Monument Avenue location. Several council members said that the hearing changed their opinions on the matter, especially comments by Ashe's brother and widow. The groundbreaking was eventually held on August 15. 500 attended the event, and several people raised Confederate flags behind the stage.\n\nOn January 1, 1996, the Richmond Times-Dispatch published a letter by Moutoussamy-Ashe. In the letter, she argued that the monument \"honors Richmond, Virginia, more than it does its son, his legacy, and his life's work.\" According to Moutossamy-Ashe, her husband had expected the monument to go in front of an African-American sports hall-of-fame. Several days later, Moutoussamy-Ashe reached an agreement with Citizens for Excellence in Public Art, a group led by gallery owner Beverly Reynolds, wherein both parties would help raise $20 million for the envisioned hall-of-fame, and the DiPasquale statue would be moved there upon completion. At this point, CEMA would hold a $1 million international competition to find a better design to be placed at Monument Avenue. The group had raised $200 thousand by the time Richmond City Council shot their plan down.\n\nThe statue was cast by DiPasquale in Waynesboro, Virginia and shipped to Richmond on a flatbed truck driven by Robbie Drumheller. The statue was placed upon its pedestal on July 3, 1996, and unveiled on July 10.\n\nGeorge Floyd protests\nOn July 1, 2020, amid the George Floyd protests, Mayor Levar Stoney ordered all statues to Confederate generals on city property taken down; as a result, the only statue remaining on Monument Avenue is that of Ashe.\n\nOn July 16, the pedestal of the monument was vandalized with spray paint reading \"White Lives Matter\" and \"WLM.\" A man claiming to be the vandal spoke to passers-by, saying \"You put it on our statues, I'll put it on yours.\" Ashe's family gave the city of Richmond permission to remove the statue if this was needed to protect it from further harm; this was initially misreported as a request to remove the statue.\n\nReception\nIn 2017, Mental Floss named the monument #3 on its listicle \"10 Unintentionally Horrifying Statues of Famous People,\" writing that Ashe was \"frozen forever in a state of seemingly mocking [the children] for their lack of height.\" When reached out to by Salon, sculptor DiPasquale said that \"If you always see what you always saw, you will always get what you always got,\" and that \"judging art, like life, depends on what you bring to it, I'm sure.\"\n\nReferences\n\nSculptures of books\nBuildings and structures in Richmond, Virginia\nMonuments and memorials in Virginia\nMonument Avenue\nOutdoor sculptures in Virginia\nSculptures of African Americans\nSculptures of children in Virginia\nSculptures of men in Virginia\nStatues in Virginia\nStatues of sportspeople\nVandalized works of art in Virginia"}
{"eng_Latn":"The eastern pygmy marmoset (Cebuella niveiventris) is a marmoset species, a very small New World monkey, found in the southwestern Amazon Rainforest in Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru. It was formerly regarded as conspecific with the similar western pygmy marmoset, but the eastern pygmy marmoset has whitish colored underparts. Although the eastern pygmy marmoset occurs further east than the western pygmy marmoset, the primary separators of their ranges are the Amazon River (Solim\u00f5es River) and Maranon River, with the western occurring to the north of them and the eastern to the south. The species has recently been confirmed by DNA testing to exist in Ecuador, hundreds of kilometers north of the Maranon River.\n\nPhysical description \nThe eastern pygmy marmoset weighs around 119 grams and have a head size ranging from 33.7 to 38.9mm, being one of the smallest New World monkeys. In the wild, full grown adult males weigh approximately 110 grams whereas adult females can weigh around 120 grams. All pygmy marmosets share a common attribute where they have a mane of fur covering their ears, arms that are longer than their hind legs, and they have no protocone in their first upper premolar tooth. Due to their specific diet, the eastern pygmy marmoset also has large lower incisors and a strong V-shaped lower jaw. The eastern pygmy marmoset also has claw-like nails which are beneficial for actions such as poking holes in tree bark to obtain food, as well as the claw-like nails allows them to cling vertically to tree trunks.\n\nAs different subspecies of the pygmy marmoset have different coloration patterns, the eastern pygmy is more of a white, pale color. The species has whiteish underparts which include their arms and legs, as well as their throat and chest having a more orange to white coloration.\n\nEcology\n\nDistribution \nThe eastern pygmy marmoset are small arboreal nonhuman primates that cover a large geographic distribution.  As it was confirmed by DNA the eastern pygmy marmoset is located primarily south of the Rio Solim\u00f5es river (Amazon River) covering parts of Peru, Brazil, Equator and Bolivia. The species covers a larger range in Brazil and Peru, present in the Amazonian lowlands and Andean foothills. The home range of this nonhuman primate also stretches a little into northern Bolivia.\n\nDiet \nThe eastern pygmy marmoset is similar to the general species as they have a specific high-quality, rare food diet. They are considered mainly to be exudativores as well as insectivores. The eastern pygmy marmosets feed primarily on plant exudates which consist of tree sap, tree gum as well as latex from trees and lianas. This consists of a large portion of their diet. They are known at times to also eat arthropods, primarily being insects, and occasionally eat fruits for extra nutrition.\n\nThe species, due to their particular diet, has dental as well as nail adaptations in order to gnaw, dig, and cling vertically to trees; these are all behaviors associated with feeding as well as exudate foraging.\n\nReferences\n\nCebuella\nMammals described in 1940\nPrimates of South America\nTaxa named by Einar L\u00f6nnberg"}

{"eng_Latn":"Monica Baskin is an American psychologist who is a professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Her research considers health disparities in the Deep South. She serves as Director of Community Outreach and Engagement at the O'Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nEarly life and education \nBaskin grew up in Southwest Atlanta. Her mother and father were from rural Georgia and Alabama. Her father was diagnosed with eye neoplasm when she was a child, and ultimately lost his eye. Baskin has said that she remembers being told that she \"would need to be 'twice as good' as her white peers in order to be as successful,\". She studied psychology and sociology at Emory University. She moved to Georgia State University for her graduate studies, where she earned a master's degree in community counselling. She remained at Georgia State for her doctoral research, where she studied public health interventions for adolescents diagnosed with sickle cell disease. After losing her father to cancer whilst she was still at high school, Baskin became interested in why physical and psychological distress was still so taboo in communities of colour. Like many other African-Americans, her father was only diagnosed with cancer when he was at stage 4, which meant that death was inevitable. She has said that she was motivated to work on health disparities because she realised that there weren't many people who looked like her in the field. She was sponsored by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Loan Repayment Programme which allows scientists studying health disparities to start their independent research careers without student loan debt. After graduating, Baskin returned to Emory University, where she was awarded a paediatric psychology fellowship. In 1997 Baskin was made a Minority Fellow of the American Psychological Association.\n\nResearch and career \nBaskin is a psychologist who investigates the physical and mental health of minorities. Her research considers how lifestyle impacts medical outcomes, and how behavioural interventions can help to mitigate health disparities.\n\nIn 2013 Baskin coordinated the report \"PLACE MATTERS for Health in Jefferson County, Alabama: The Status of Health Equity on the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in Birmingham, Alabama\". The report was released fifty years after the protests in Birmingham marking when the Jim Crow laws were overruled. The report collected information of life expectancy, infant mortality and access to healthy food in various areas across the county, and studied how they depended on the demographics of the communities (including ethnicity and socioeconomic status). She identified that Black mothers in Jefferson County were 2.5 times more likely to die during child birth as white mothers, and that Black households in Jefferson County had annual incomes $22,000 below the federal poverty guideline. The report made a series of recommendations, including funding early childhood education programmes, implementing financial programmes to provide healthy food in poor neighbourhoods and expanding Medicaid.\n\nIn 2015 Baskin was awarded an National Cancer Institute grant to develop strategies to prevent obesity in African American women. Her research has shown the close relationships between cancer and obesity, and identified that African American women are most at risk.\n\nBaskin is Chair of the Jefferson County Collaborative for Health Equity, an organisation which looks to eliminate health disparities through public policy. In 2020 she was elected President of the Society of Behavioral Medicine.\n\nSelected publications\n\nAwards and honours \n 1997 American Psychological Association Minority Fellow\n 2007 Jefferson County Public Health Hero Awards\n 2013 University of Alabama Institute for Rural Health Research Rural Health Heroes Award\n 2016 Max Cooper Award for Excellence in Research\n 2016 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Culture of Health Leader\n 2017 Fellow of the Society of Behavioral Medicine\n\nPersonal life \nBaskin has two daughters.

{"eng_Latn":"The Path is the sixth studio album by American metalcore band Fit for a King. It was released on September 18, 2020, through Solid State Records and was produced by Drew Fulk. It is the band's first release with guitarist Daniel Gailey. It is also the last album to feature the band's founding drummer Jared Easterling before he left the band in December 2021.\n\nBackground and promotion\nOn March 13, 2020, the band unveiled a new single titled \"Breaking the Mirror\" along with an accompanying lyric video. On July 8, the band announced the album itself, the album cover, the track list, and release date. On July 10, the band released the second single \"God of Fire\" featuring Ryo Kinoshita of Crystal Lake.\n\nOn August 6, the band released the third single \"Locked (In My Head)\". On August 25, the band teased on their social media accounts that the fourth and final single titled \"Annihilation\" would be released on August 28. On that day, three weeks before the album release, the band released the single. On September 18, the day of the album release, the band released a music video for the title track.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe album received positive reviews from critics. AllMusic gave the album a positive review saying, \"Setting fire to the landscape, Texan metalcore outfit Fit for a King take a scorched approach to their brutal sixth set, The Path.\" CaliberTV scored the album 7 out of 10 and said: \"Fit for a King are on to greener pastures and, undoubtedly, tomorrow's answer to a Killswitch Engage or As I Lay Dying. While certainly a deserved title, don't be fooled by this album's lofty aspirations. Fit for a King earned this by being the most consistent band in their genre. The Path does nothing to tarnish that fact.\" Damon Taylor from Dead Press! rated the album positively and saying: \"With The Path, Fit for a King show a band prepared and evidently ready to move towards a more grand and stadium ready sound. With the tracks to back up their ambitions, they're well on their way towards the front of the metalcore pack.\" Distorted Sound scored the album 7 out of 10 and said: \"The Path may be well-worn but it's worth taking all the same. FIT FOR A KING don't do originality, but they write great songs and some of these cuts will be stuck in your head for days. They're very easy to like too and it'll only take a couple of spins before the hooks are dug in deep. This is refined, professional and if you can make it to the end without wanting to find a stage to jump off, you're made of stronger stuff than us.\"\n\nJesus Freak Hideout rated the album 4 out of 5 and said: \"Dark Skies was the sound of a band perfecting music they were comfortable with. By departing somewhat from their former sound, The Path ushers in moments that just don't fit as well (e.g., parts of 'God of Fire' or 'Vendetta') and, consequently, misses on the cohesion that Dark Skies had. But overall, the band plays their music well, and the variety is a welcome addition. Even on their new path, Fit for a King shows they have the ability to travel it well.\" Kerrang! gave the album 3 out of 5 and stated: \"Fit for a King are one of those bands who always seem to be just\u2026 there. The Path is their sixth album in a decade, and they've never been less than consistent and highly effective. Despite this, they've never really made that step up to modern metal's top table. The Path, however, is the sound of a band making a big, energised effort to change all that.\" Rock 'N' Load praised the album saying, \"The Path is full of all the aspects that make enjoyable Metalcore, from the soaring vocals to the shattering breakdowns, you will be testing your lung capacity whilst joining in with the vocals and then smashing anything in range as the drums pick up and the pit becomes chaotic with the heavy aspects. There is no denying that The Path will continue the popularity of Fit for a King and should push them to the next level.\" Wall of Sound gave the album a score 8.5\/10 and saying: \"Fit for a King continuously manage to impress fans all over the globe, including myself by using what works for them musically and improving on that sound. Hopefully, they will be down under again soon, but until then, playing this album on repeat is almost just as good.\"\n\nTrack listing\nAdapted from Apple Music.\n\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from Discogs.\n\nFit for a King\n Ryan Kirby \u2013 lead vocals\n Bobby Lynge \u2013 guitars, backing vocals\n Daniel Gailey \u2013 guitars, backing vocals\n Ryan \"Tuck\" O'Leary \u2013 bass, clean vocals\n Jared Easterling \u2013 drums\n\nAdditional musicians\n Ryo Kinoshita of Crystal Lake \u2013 guest vocals on track 7\n\nAdditional personnel\n Drew Fulk \u2013 production, engineering, mixing, mastering, composition\n Brandon Ebel \u2013 executive production\n Jeff Dunne \u2013 engineering, mixing, mastering\n Taylor Kimball \u2013 engineering\n Cory Hajde \u2013 management\n Matt Anderson \u2013 booking\n Adam Skatula \u2013 A&R\n Corinne Alexandra \u2013 artwork, design, photography\n\nCharts\n\nReferences\n\n2020 albums\nFit for a King (band) albums\nSolid State Records albums"}

The organiser was forced into liquidation in July 2020.\n\nOrganisation\n\nThe steam rally was first organised by Len Murray and held at Lower Green Farm, Sotterley.\nGiven the numbers of attendees, and with the support of John Rous, 4th Earl of Stradbroke, the event moved to Henham Park in 1975.\nThe rally is run by the parochial church councils of Wangford-cum-Henham, Uggeshall and Sotherton; the Wangford Community Council and Southwold (Sole Bay) Lions Club.\nIt is usually held in the Henham Park fields, but on five occasions has taken place elsewhere; at Sibton, Brampton, the Norfolk Showground (west of Norwich), Benacre and Trinity Park, Ipswich.\nThere is an entrance fee, and camping in the park is allowed for an additional fee.\n\nThe rally is a charity that gives its profits to local organisations.\nAt the 37th rally in September 2012 over \u00a340,000 was raised for local charities.\nIn 2018 profits went to the UK Sepsis Trust, East Anglian Air Ambulance, Wrentham Community First Responders, SERV Suffolk and Cambridgeshire and Southwold Lifeboat Station.\nIn 2019 recipients included Wangford and District Community Council, Southwold (Sole Bay) Lions Club, Parochial Church Councils of Sotherton, Wangford cum Henham and Uggeshall, Lowestoft and Waveney Samaritans, National Trust Dunwich Heath and Beccles and District Guides.\n\nOn 9 July 2020 it was reported that Henham Steam Rally Trading Ltd, the company based in Beccles which organised the steam rally, had been wound up because it could not afford to pay for an injury incurred in an accident in 2015.\nDamages of \u00a376,160 were owing to a Colchester man.\n\nAttractions\n\nSeveral thousand visitors come to the Grand Henham Steam Rally, which as of 2020 had been run each year for 45 years.\nTypically there is a bandstand with live music, craft tent and craft stalls, trade stands, food stands and a bar, a vintage fairground, a clown and a Punch and Judy puppet show for children.\nDisplays and demonstrations include steam engines, stationary engines, working agricultural machinery, vintage & classic cars, vintage commercial & military vehicles, tractors and motorcycles.\n\nIn 2012 there was a parade of steam engines followed by the Southwold and Reydon Corps of Drums, a demonstration of kite flying by Team Spectrum, a parade of vintage and classic cars, and a commercial and military vehicle parade.\nThere was a special pageant, From the sickle to the combine harvester, that told of the evolution of harvesting over the ages.\nIn September 2018 the 44th Grand Henham Steam Rally for the first time let attendees drive a steam engine.\nAnother new display was steam roller barrel rolling.\nThe 2018 rally also included a Dog and Duck Show, where trained sheepdogs herded ducks, and a display of working Shires and Suffolk Punch horses.\nOther events have included a stunt team display, the Ken Fox motorcycle Wall of Death troupe, horse-drawn carriage rides and a dog agility display.\n\n2020 and 2021 events\n\nThe 2020 rally was to have included more than 30 full size and miniature traction engines, steam rollers, lorries and cars. \nThere would be working demonstrations of steam power, including threshing, sawing benches, and stone crushing.\nThe organizing committee for the 2020 rally considered cashless payments, wide one-way aisles to make social distancing practical and greater cleaning, but it steadily became obvious that there would be no way to make the event safe for visitors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn 3 July 2020 it was decided to cancel the 46th Grand Henham Steam Rally, which was to have been held on 19\u201320 September 2020, due to government restrictions on large events.\nThe next rally was planned for 18\u221219 September 2021 at Henham Park.\n\nAlthough Government COVID-19 restrictions had been eased in July 2021, and despite careful consideration given to options for safely running the 2021 rally, the organising committee felt that continuing uncertainties, and the short time available in which to organise the event, were such that it could not be held in those circumstances.

{"eng_Latn":"Clarence Keiser Hinkle was born in Auburn, California on June 19, 1880 and died July 21, 1960. Hinkle was an American painter and art educator. His art studio was in Laguna Beach, California and later in Santa Barbara, California.\n\nAbout\n\nEarly life and education \nAt age 18 he studied at Crocker Art Gallery under painter William Franklin Jackson. By 1900, he moved to San Francisco to study at San Francisco Art Institute (then known as California School of Design) with Arthur Frank Mathews. From 1901 until 1903, he enrolled in the Art Students League of New York and studied under John Twachtman and William Merritt Chase. From 1904 until 1906, he studied at Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia.\n\nIn May 1906, he was awarded the Cresson Scholarship, a traveling scholarship to Paris for two years of travel, and he studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian. While studying in Paris, Hinkle was influenced by Impressionism and Pointillism.\n\nCareer \nFrom 1912 until 1917, Hinkle lived in San Francisco. He moved to Los Angeles in 1917 and taught at Louise Elizabeth Garden MacLeod's Los Angeles School of Art and Design. Hinkle later taught painting and drawing at the Chouinard Art Institute from 1921 until 1935. His students included Millard Sheets and Phil Dike, among others. He taught his students to experiment with their work, paint from nature, and use loose brushstrokes to capture the subject. Hinkle had a wife, Mabel Bain and she had been a former student.\n\nHe had an art studio in Laguna Beach, California from 1922 to 1935, and he was a member of the Laguna Beach Art Association. Hinkle opened another studio in Santa Barbara, California in 1935. He painted landscapes, still lifes and portraits. Hinkle painted many coastal landscapes in the 1920s. Initially while living in California Hinkle worked within Impressionist style, but eventually moved in to more of an expressionistic modernist style, he is also associated with Post-Impressionism. Other early-Modernist in California include Rinaldo Cuneo, Ray Strong, and Charles Reiffel.\n\nHinkle was a member of the Group of Eight, alongside artists Edouard Vysekal, Luvena Buchanan Vysekal, John Hubbard Rich, Henri De Kruif, Donna N. Schuster,  E. Roscoe Shrader, and Mabel Alvarez. This Group of Eight was organized largely by Luvena Buchanan Vyeskal and Edouard Vyeskal, and the group had a basis in the progressive art movement in California.\n\nDeath and legacy \nHe died on July 21, 1960, in Santa Barbara, at age 80. His wife Mabel donated one of his paintings to the Smithsonian American Art Museum posthumously. More than a hundred of Hinkle's paintings were left by his estate to the University of Pacific, which were sold in 1986 to a single collector in Santa Barbara.\n\nHis work was acquired by the San Diego Museum of Art, the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, the De Young Museum in San Francisco, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\n\nIn 2012, more than 114 of his paintings were exhibited at the Laguna Art Museum.\n\nExhibitions \nThis is a select list of notable exhibitions that featured Hinkle.\n\nSolo exhibitions \n\n 1960 \u2013 Clarence Hinkle: 1880-1960, solo exhibition, Santa Barbara Museum of Art, Santa Barbara, California\n 2012 \u2013 Clarence Hinkle, solo exhibition at Laguna Art Museum, Laguna Beach, California\n\nGroup exhibitions \n\n 1922 \u2013 group exhibition with Hinkle, Edward Weston, Margrethe Mather, Howard Russell Butler, Jean Mannheim, Henri De Kruif, John Hubbard Rich, John Wesley Cotton, Howell Chambers Brown, Nellie Huntington Gere, at the MacDowell Club, Tajo Building, Los Angeles, California\n 1933\u20131934 \u2013 Painting and Sculpture from 16 American Cities, group exhibition, Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York City, New York\n 1962 \u2013 Clarence Hinkle and William Rohrbach, group exhibition, Esther Bear Gallery, Santa Barbara, California\n 2004 \u2013 Laguna Beach: Our Town in the Early 1900s, group exhibition with Hinkle, William Wendt, Joseph Kleitsch, Edgar Alwin Payne, Anna Althea Hills, at Laguna Art Museum, Laguna Beach, California\n 2012 \u2013 Modern Spirit and the Group of Eight, group exhibition with Hinkle, Mabel Alvarez, Henri de Kruif, John Hubbard Rich, Donna N.

{"eng_Latn":"Violent Allies is the ninth studio album by American alternative metal band 10 Years. It was released on September 18, 2020. Its first single, \"The Shift\", was released ahead of the album in May 2020.\n\nWriting and recording\nThe band began on work on the album in 2019, deciding to work with music producer Howard Benson. The band had previously worked with Benson on 2010's Feeding the Wolves, but wished to try it again, feeling that issues between band members and their record label at the time kept them from reaching their potential with working with Benson the first time around. The recording sessions began in late 2019, with the band entering the studio with Benson 20 songs already written. Much to their surprise, the sessions were much more challenging than expected, with Benson cutting 75% of the material the band had previously written. This forced the band to write new material on the spot in the studio. Guitarist Brian Vodinh elaborated on the difficult sessions:\n\nThemes and composition\nThe album's title, Violent Allies, has a dual meaning, representing both the band's strong determination to work together to create a meaningful album, and an allusion to the divisiveness present in modern social and political issues. The latter is a recurring theme across much of the album, and the album's lead single \"The Shift\". While \"The Shift\" also contains multiple allusions to the \"spreading of a virus,\" the song was written in late 2019, prior to the Coronavirus outbreak.\n\nRelease and promotion\nThe album's first single, \"The Shift\", was first released on May 15, 2020, well in advance of the album, which, at the time, was untitled and had no release date, due to the uncertainty in regards to the COVID-19 pandemic. The album's title, Violent Allies, and its release date, September 18, 2020 were announced in mid-July, alongside a new promotional song titled \"The Unknown\".\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel\n10 Years\n Jesse Hasek \u2013 lead vocals\n Brian Vodinh \u2013 guitar, bass, drums, backing vocals, keys, programming \n Matt Wantland \u2013 guitar\n\nProduction\n Howard Benson \u2013 production\n Joe Rickard \u2013 mixing\n\nCharts\n\nReferences\n\n2020 albums\n10 Years (band) albums\nMascot Records albums"}

{"eng_Latn":"Theresa Greenfield (born October 20, 1963) is an American businesswoman, government official, and former political candidate. She was the Democratic nominee for the 2020 United States Senate election in Iowa, losing to incumbent Republican Joni Ernst.\n\nOn November 18, 2021, Greenfield was appointed USDA Rural Development director for Iowa.\n\nEarly life and education \nGreenfield was born and raised in Bricelyn, Minnesota, a small city near the Iowa\u2013Minnesota border. She was one of five children. Her parents raised hogs and grew crops on a small farm, and her father was also a crop dusting pilot. She helped with farm jobs such as driving tractors and grain trucks, bailing hay, and feeding hogs; and by the age of 16, assisted in negotiating contract terms and demarcating fields for the family crop-dusting business.\n\nGreenfield took courses at Iowa Lakes Community College and Iowa State University before graduating from Minnesota State University, Mankato in 1987 with a bachelor's degree in design and human development.\n\nBusiness career \nAfter graduating from Minnesota State, Greenfield worked as an urban planner and later began working in real estate development.\n\nIn 2005, Greenfield took a position at the home building company Rottlund Homes in Roseville, Minnesota, where she was named president of the Iowa division in 2007. In 2012, she became president of the Des Moines commercial real estate firm Colby Interests, based in Windsor Heights, Iowa. She is a member of the board of the American Institute of Certified Planners, Commercial Real Estate Women of Iowa, and the Windsor Heights Chamber of Commerce.\n\nPolitical campaigns\n\n2018 U.S. House election \n\nIn July 2017, Greenfield announced her candidacy for the 2018 Democratic nomination in Iowa's 3rd congressional district. As a female Democratic candidate in 2018, she was featured on the cover of Time along with other female candidates, who were collectively labeled \"The Avengers\".\n\nShe withdrew from the race in March 2018 after learning her campaign manager had falsified some of the 1,790 required signatures to qualify her for the ballot. Her campaign tried to collect a new set of signatures in the 24 hours before the filing deadline, but was only able to acquire 1,592 valid signatures.\n\n2020 U.S. Senate election\n\nOn June 3, 2019, Greenfield declared her candidacy for the Senate seat held by first-term Senator Joni Ernst.\nOn June 2, 2020, she won the Democratic primary with 47.71% of the vote, defeating three other major candidates, including Michael T. Franken, a retired U.S. Navy admiral and former aide to U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy.\n\nPolls conducted after the primary showed a close contest between Greenfield and Ernst. In early September, political handicappers The Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball rated the race as a toss-up. Major media described the race as one of the most likely to decide control of the Senate after the 2020 election. Through June 30, 2020, Greenfield had raised $11.5 million, compared to $14.6 million for Ernst. In the third fundraising quarter, Greenfield's campaign raised $28.7 million, more than any Senate candidate in Iowa history. As of October 2020, the race was expected to be the most expensive in the state's history, and the second most expensive Senate race in the United States, after the 2020 United States Senate election in North Carolina.\n\nGreenfield received endorsements from former President Barack Obama, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, Representative Abby Finkenauer, Representative Dave Loebsack, former Iowa first lady and education advocate Christie Vilsack, and former Lieutenant Governor of Iowa Sally Pederson. She was endorsed by organizations including the Iowa AFL-CIO, Iowa IBEW State Conference, EMILY's List, End Citizens United, and Giffords.\n\nIn the general election on November 3, 2020, she was defeated by incumbent Ernst, winning only 8 of the state's 99 counties and an estimated 7 points behind the incumbent. Greenfield conceded the race in a speech that night and on her Twitter account the following day.\n\nDepartment of Agriculture \n\nIn 2021, president Joe Biden appointed Greenfield as Iowa director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program. Greenfield works under U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, a former Governor of Iowa.\n\nPolitical positions\n\nHealthcare \nGreenfield is in favor of the Affordable Care Act and expanding\nMedicaid. She has supported a public option for health insurance coverage, but does not support Medicare for All. She supports paid sick leave for all workers. She also supports abortion rights.\n\nShe has called for further federal stimulus to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, including direct payments to individuals, extending expanded unemployment benefits, and expanded Paycheck Protection Program payments for small businesses. She also called for a statewide mask mandate to alleviate the spread of the COVID-19 virus.\n\nSocial safety nets \nShe supports Social Security and other safety net policies, and has referred to her personal experience as part of her reasons for this.\n\nCampaign finance reform \nGreenfield supports campaign finance reform and supports the overturning of Citizens United v. FEC, a Supreme Court decision that prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for political communications by corporations.  She proposed a ban on corporate Political Action Committee money, passing lobbying reforms, and overturning the Supreme Court's decision on Citizens United. She supports the Stop Swaps, Protect Local Jobs Act.\n\nEnvironment \nShe understands the scientific consensus on climate change, and the need for federal action, linking the climate change to the August 2020 Midwest derecho which caused flooding in Iowa, and has criticized Senator Joni Ernst for taking money from the oil industry and for denying the scientific consensus on climate change.\n\nPersonal life \nIn 1985, Greenfield married Rodney Wirtjes, an electrician, who served as a journeyman lineworker and a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. They settled in Buffalo Center, Iowa. In 1988, Wirtjes was killed in a work accident. At the time Greenfield was 24 years old, with a one-year-old son, and was pregnant with her second son who was born five months later. She credits Social Security, workers' compensation, and family support with helping her during that time.\n\nGreenfield later married Steve Miller, with whom she had two more children.

At the time of her work's unveiling, she called it her most complex sculpture.\n\nDescription \n\nThe installation artist Sarah Sze designed Shorter than the Day as a spherical constellation of suspended rods. Around its edges are 900 photographs of the New York sky shot from dawn to dusk. As the Earth revolves around the sun, by walking the perimeter of the work, the viewer sees the sky shift from day to night.\n\nThe sculpture hangs in LaGuardia Airport Terminal B, where it starts on the departures level atrium and passes through an opening in the floor into the baggage claim level. It is titled in reference to Emily Dickenson's poem, \"Because I could not stop for Death\".\n\nProduction \n\nLaGuardia Gateway Partners and the Public Art Fund commissioned Shorter than the Day. Sze wanted the installation to be \"almost like a mirage\", ethereal and fragile, while capturing the \"feeling of shifting time and place\" that goes with air travel. She was also inspired by the definitional Grand Central Terminal clock. \n\nThe sculpture was fabricated by Amuneal, based in Philadelphia. Sze, a New York-based artist, was in the city during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and so continued her work on the sculpture with her team during that time. The printed photographs are connected to the aluminum and steel rods with alligator clips. The work weighs five tons.\n\nAt the time of the sculpture's unveiling, on June 11, 2020, Sze considered the work her most complex yet.

After an arrest for entering a women's bathroom in Bulawayo in 2014, she filed a civil lawsuit for damages which she won in 2019. By that point, she had taken asylum in the US and she now lives in Maryland.\n\nCareer and activism \nRikki Nathanson (born ) studied at the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, becoming a company secretary. After transitioning, she opened a modelling agency in 2005. Her activism started around 2007, when she joined the board of the Sexual Rights Centre. Nathanson founded Trans Research Education Advocacy and Training (TREAT) in 2015. She is involved in the Southern Africa Trans Forum and Africa Key Populations Expert Group, which reports to the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nCourtcases \nIn January 2014, Nathanson was arrested in a nightclub in Bulawayo on the charge of criminal nuisance, after using a women's toilet. Six police officers wearing riot gear took her into custody, where she spent three days and two nights, being subjected to physical examinations to confirm her gender. When the case came to court, the judge asked the prosecution to explain what the nuisance had been and it was established no crime had been committed, so the charge was dropped.\n\nNathanson then decided upon a civil lawsuit against Farai Mteliso (the ZANU\u2013PF activist who had called the police), Augustine Chihuri (then Commissioner-General of the police), Ignatius Chombo (then Minister of Home Affairs) and Chief Inspector Enock Masimba (then Bulawayo Central Police commander).\n\nAfter five years, Nathanson won her court case in 2019. At the High Court, Justice Francis Bere stated in his summing up that \"One cannot avoid concluding that the conduct of the police in arresting and detaining the plaintiff was quite outrageous because clearly, they abused their discretion in arresting her\". He awarded damages of ZW$400,000 to Nathanson and left the costs to the defendants. Nathanson had requested for US$2.7 million in damages and ZW$400,000 was approximately US$1,100 at the time. \"We are happy that justice, fairness and compassion has prevailed\" said Tashwill Esterhuizen, a lawyer at the Southern African Litigation Centre (SALC).

{"eng_Latn":"Techno Drive is a 1998 driving simulator arcade game developed and published by Namco in Japan. It is known for its unique graphical interface that uses fluorescent colors choices and flat shading. Players control a racecar throughout a variety of different minigames, each testing their skill and reaction time. Minigames include drifting along corners, avoiding collision with other vehicles, and driving with a bowl of liquid attached to the rear of the car. The game was designed for the Namco System 12, an arcade board based on raw PlayStation hardware.\n\nTechno Drive is the second in Namco's Almighty Human Project series of simulation games, which also include Gynotai and Photo Battle. Its futuristic aesthetic was designed by Minoru Sashida, who is known for his work on titles such as the Mr. Driller series and Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere. Critics praised Techno Drive for its unique gameplay structure and presentation, finding it a welcome change in pace from other arcade racers of the era.\n\nGameplay\n\nTechno Drive is a driving simulator video game. Its plot revolves around Japan's escalating traffic problems causing the country's roads to become paralyzed and deteriorating the driving ability of its population. The player is sent back to the past via a futuristic race car to rehabilitate drivers and prevent the problems of the future. The objective of the game is to control a car through a variety of racing-themed minigames under a limited amount of time. They are designed to test the player's skill and reaction time, judged by a letter grade from A\u2212 to E at the end. Minigames are split into three categories: Steering Technique, which only utilize the steering wheel; Footwork Technique, which use only the gas pedal and brake; and Practical Technique, which make use of all three. Objectives in these minigames differ for each one, including drifting around sharp corners, avoiding collision with other vehicles, driving with a bowl of liquid attached and avoiding any spills, dribbling a ball to the goal, and driving only when a large eyeball is closed. Only three minigames from each category can be played in a single game. Upon completion, the arcade cabinet prints out the player's results and letter grade.\n\nDevelopment and release\nTechno Drive is the second game in Namco's Almighty Human Project series, which also include the skeeball-esque Gyontai (1996) and action game Photo Battle (2003). It was designed by a small team of employees led by Minoru Sashida, a designer that was known for his work on redemption games and mechanical prize-winning machines; Sashida used the knowledge he gained from these while developing Techno Drive. Sashida worked primarily on the game's graphical interface, which features bold, fluorescent color choices and flat-shaded polygons. Techno Drive was designed to be vastly different and distinct from Namco's previous racing game offerings, such as Ridge Racer (1993), and appealing towards a wide player demographic. The upbeat electronic soundtrack was composed by Koji Nakagawa, who later went on to compose the music for Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere (1999).\n\nTechno Drive was demonstrated at the 1998 Amusement Operator's Union (AOU) tradeshow at the Makuhari Messe convention center in Tokyo, alongside games such as Ehrgeiz, Time Crisis II, and Panic Park. Its original concept attracted attention from publications. The game was published on July 1, 1998 in Japan.\n\nReception and legacy\nGame Machine listed Techno Drive as being the third most popular arcade game of August 1998. A reviewer for Edge described Techno Drive as being a \"complete and drastic departure for Namco\", and a game that distinguished itself from most other racing arcade games with its futuristic presentation and vastly-different gameplay structure. The reviewer said that it drastically departs from the real-world setting of Namco's previous racing games, such as the Ridge Racer series, and as such made it an intriguing title. Staff from Next Generation believed that Techno Drive possessed the same amount of innovation as Soulcalibur, which was released in the same time frame. They admired the game's stylized graphics, which they took as \"a concession to the real meat of the game: technical driving ability\". Staff also expressed disappointment towards the lack of any kind of home release. A writer for the Italian publication MegaConsole enjoyed Techno Drive for its immersive techno atmosphere and printer feature. Console Plus writers found Techno Drive to be an aesthetically-pleasing arcade game, and its unique concept made it stand out from other titles.\n\nMax Krieger, the creator of the puzzle game CROSSNIQ+, credits Techno Drive for inspiring most of the look and presentation used in his game. A song from the game appears as a playable track in the Nintendo Switch game Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum 'n' Fun!. The music used for the Footwork Technique minigames was played live at Ridge Racer Night 2, a concert hosted to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Ridge Racer in 2014. In July 2015, Bandai Namco Entertainment announced it would cease support for Techno Drive due to a shortage of necessary parts.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1998 video games\nArcade video games\nArcade-only video games\nDriving simulators\nJapan-exclusive video games\nNamco games\nRacing video games\nVideo games developed in Japan"}

{"eng_Latn":"Rhys Caparn (1909\u20131997) was an American sculptor known for her animal, landscape, and architectural subjects. Her works were mostly abstract but based on natural forms. In many of them she employed free lines and used a restrained style that nonetheless conveyed what critics saw as an emotional charge. In the animal sculptures for which she became best known, she achieved what a critic called \"a graceful curvilinear balance.\" Another critic put this aspect of her style in terms of the arch of a cat's back in one of her pieces: \"A cat's arched back is a pleasingly rounded shape and well balanced on the foundation of paws. But it is still a cat's back, embodying a cat's peculiar physical response to fear or affection.\" Her foundational influences included an ancient Greek statue and the abstract works of Constantin Brancusi. From her most prominent instructor, Alexander Archipenko, she said she learned to seek out the underlying ideal in a natural form, the point at which \"form and idea become one.\" Her works were mostly small and almost all made by modeling.\n\nShe received her training in Paris and New York. With the support of her parents and two wealthy widows, she was able to devote her time to study and creative work and her sculptures made an immediate impact when first shown in the early 1930s. Throughout the rest of her long career, she exhibited frequently in commercial galleries, museums, and the shows of the nonprofit associations of which she was a member. She helped to form the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors in 1940 and thereafter served as one of its leaders. In the 1940s and 1950s, she taught sculpture classes two days a week at the Dalton School in Manhattan. She won a prestigious and controversial award from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1951. She died of Alzheimer's disease in 1997.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nCaparn was born in 1909 in a resort town north of New York City. Her father was a noted landscape architect and her mother a successful voice teacher. In 1926, during her senior year in a local private school, her mother brought her to France for a visit with her sister Anne who was studying in Paris. During a visit to the Louvre, Caparn encountered an ancient sculpture, a kore of a young female acolyte from the Heraion of Samos. The sculpture is a standing figure missing its head wearing traditional garments with almost no body parts exposed. The piece has been described as a subtle handling of the layered fabrics' lines and folds. Caparn later said it became a major influence in shaping her approach to art.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, she spent two years as a student in Bryn Mawr College where an art history course in ancient Greek sculpture captured her attention. Her realization that a four-year liberal arts education was not for her coincided with a minor crisis in the life of her older sister, Anne. Despite the stock market crash of 1929, their mother found money enough for the two sisters to spend a year in Paris. Once there, Caparn began studies under an animal sculptor, \u00c9douard Navellier, at the \u00c9cole Artistique des Animaux. She later recalled that the school maintained a menagerie including a wild boar. The boar, she said, was tame in comparison with a savage goose that was also present. Returning home at the end of 1930 she took a further two and a half years of instruction from the avant-garde sculptor Alexander Archipenko in his school in Manhattan. She sculpted human torsos during this period but soon realized that she preferred animal forms. She began going to the Bronx Zoo and for the next two years made many drawings of animals.\n\nCaparn later credited two women with the guidance and financial aid she needed to complete her studies and embark on a career as a professional sculptor. The first was Elizabeth Alexander, widow of the painter John White Alexander. Elizabeth Alexander helped make Caparn's time in Paris \"the most wonderful year in the world\" by giving her and her sister a place to live, by finding studio space for her to work in, by arranging for her to study with Navellier, and, later, by encouraging her to attend classes with Archipenko. The second woman was Lee Wood Haggin (1856\u20131934). Like Alexander, Lee Wood Haggin was a wealthy widow whose philanthropy contributed to New York culture in general and to artists in particular. Both women were connected to the MacDowell Club. Haggin was its founder and leading financial supporter and Alexander was active in its affairs. They were both residents of Onteora, the private community where Caparn was born. Caparn later said of Haggin, \"Mrs. Haggin helped me a great deal, simply because of the kind of person she was.\"\n\nCareer in art\n\nCaparn's first exhibition took place in 1932 a few days before her twenty-third birthday. It was held in conjunction with a concert by baritone Willard Fry held at the Southampton studio of his uncle the artist, Marshal Fry. She showed human and animal figures in marble, clay, and terracotta and the New York Times covered the event in its Society pages. The following year she was given an exhibition with two other artists at a commercial New York gallery called Delphic Studios. Reviewing the show in the New York Sun, critic Henry McBride said she used \"the freest lines for forms\" to make emotionally charged works to which \"the old-fashioned ideas of sculpture do not apply.\" Archipenko contributed an introduction to the Delphic Studios catalog for the exhibition. In it he wrote, \"The idealism of Rhys Caparn and her love for the spiritual permit her to create a new form of sculpture, without her losing the ability to sculpt in a naturalistic form when she so desires.\" Also in 1933, she made the animal forms that encircled an armillary sphere made by her father as part of his landscape design at the Brooklyn Botanical Garden.\n\nIn 1935 Delphic Studios gave Caparn a solo exhibition in which she showed realist portrait heads as well as animal abstractions. In this period her sculpture was not universally admired. When she participated in a group show sponsored by Salons of America in 1936, Anita Brenner of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle called attention to her \"monstrous sculpture inspired by rubber tubes.\" Late in the decade she received an invitation to join an outspoken group of extreme abstractionists called American Abstract Artists. She joined and remained a member but later said she was not particularly committed to the organization. She said it was not as collegial as the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors which she helped found in 1940.\n\nIn 1939, Caparn contributed drawings to the annual black-and-white exhibition at Grant Studios. This was the first time she showed her works on paper. She showed them frequently in later years, often in conjunction with her sculpture. In a 1967 interview she said, \"I've drawn all my life. You draw for a vocabulary; it feeds your eye\" and when, in 1983, an interviewer commented on her freedom of line, she said she drew spontaneously and very quickly.\n\nLater in 1939, Caparn participated in a group exhibition at the Passedoit Gallery. In reviewing the show Howard Devree said, \"Rhys Caparn's 'Bird' has about it more than a little of antique Chinese abstraction of treatment and her 'Stalking Cat' compasses sinister stealth.\" In 1942 Caparn exhibited sculptures of animals from countries then at war at an exhibition held at the Bronx Zoo, made posters supporting the war effort, and participated in a fund-raising event called \"Women Can Take It.\"\n\nIn 1944 Caparn was elected president of the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors (the organization she had helped to found four years earlier). In that role she wrote the Museum of Modern Art to take issue with what she called its \"increasingly reactionary policies\" toward the work of American artists. In February of that year the Wildenstein Gallery gave a one-person show of her animal sculptures and drawings. Reviewing the show, a critic for the New York Times said, \"The true spirit of all these animals has been caught.\" At the same time Naomi Jolles of the New York Post interviewed Caparn regarding her life and work. In the interview she said she saw her work was an extension of her life and added her regret that people tended to see art as something separate from the daily lives they led.\n\nCaparn began part-time work as an art instructor in 1946. Over the next 25 years, she taught classes two days a week at the Dalton School, a private school in Manhattan. She later said she was surprised how much she enjoyed the work and surprised as well that she was good at it. In 1947 she served on a jury of the National Association of Women Artists to select works for an exhibition at the National Academy of Design. When the president of the association removed a sculpture called \"The Lovers,\" Caparn resigned. She resumed her membership after the piece was re-installed following an apology from the president for what she said was a misunderstanding. Later that year she showed animal subjects in a solo exhibition at Wildenstein Galleries, including a group called \"White Stallions\" and a single piece called \"Doe\" that Devree said were among the best things she had done.\n\nThe year after that she accompanied her husband on a trip to countries behind what was then being called the Iron Curtain and after her return began, for the first time, to sculpt landscape forms. A few years later she was one of eleven sculptors to represent the United States in a competition held in London on the subject, \"The Unknown Political Prisoner.\" The piece she presented, an abstract standing figure, did not win the award, but was nonetheless pictured in a New York Times article on the event. In 1956 she was given the first of several solo and group exhibitions at the Meltzer Gallery. Calling her work \"semi-abstract,\" a critic said, \"her feeling is exclusively sculptural and has nothing to do with illustration or literary values.\" A retrospective solo exhibition at Meltzer three years later drew from Stuart Preston of the New York Times a summation of her approach. He said the sculpture was formal but also expressive and abstract but with \"acute individual characterization.\" He said she discarded the \"trivia of realism in order to concentrate on her subject's ultimate shapes.\" When in 1958 she showed with two other sculptors at the American Museum of Natural History Preston wrote that \"Rhys Caparn's carvings catch [her subjects] at fugitive moments, birds flying, gazelles leaping or horses rearing. Quick observation and a feeling for grace of movement are at work here.\" Similarly, when she showed landforms at a solo show of recent bronzes at Meltzer in 1960, Preston noted that the pieces stood \"proxy for observed landscape.\" Later that year her sculpture was included in a group show entitled \"Aspect de al Sculpture Americaine\" at the Galerie Claude Bernard, Paris. The following year she was given a retrospective solo exhibition at the Riverside Museum.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Caparn continued to participate in group exhibitions held by the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors and the National Association of Women Artists. She moved home and studio to Connecticut in the middle of the 1960s and thereafter favored local commercial galleries for exhibitions. A gallery in Bethel, Connecticut, gave her a 47-year retrospective in 1977. Reviewing the show a critic for a local paper described architectural pieces that had not previously been noted, pointing to her use of \"the sparsest elements\u2014a single while wall and lintel of its portal, a couple of arches, a village square, a fragmented empty chapel.\" Regarding a retrospective show in 1981 a critic for the New York Times wrote of landscape plaster reliefs that began to appear following her postwar trip to Eastern Europe and mentioned house shapes that had become a more recent preoccupation. This critic also mentioned a \"gentle but firm touch\" evident in her work and suggested, \"it may be that she lacks that touch of megalomania so necessary for the effective statement in three dimensions.\"\n\nPrizes\n\nCaparn received awards from the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors (later National Association of Women Artists), including its Medal of Honor for Sculpture. In a national competition called \"American Sculpture, 1951\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Caparn's \"Animal Form I\" was awarded $2,500 as second prize. The National Sculpture Society complained that the jurors unjustly favored a modernist style over the classically realist style that it advocated. A letter from the society called the award-winning pieces \"work not only of extreme modernistic and negative tendencies but mediocre left-wing work at that.\" The museum stood by its decisions and issued a statement defending the neutrality of its award policies.\n\nArtistic style\n\nCaparn's earliest influences came from her encounter with the sculptures of ancient Greece. As an art student she learned a realist technique from her Parisian art instructor, \u00c9douard Navellier, and her early animal and figure pieces were correspondingly realist in style. On returning to New York she attended an exhibition of works by Brancusi that, as she later said, completely changed her approach to art. She began to develop a style that, in 1935, Howard Devree, called a \"graceful, curvilinear balance.\" This style was not symmetrical and ornamental, but rather expressive, with the ability to create an emotional response in the viewer. Writing in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle in 1936, Anita Brenner told readers that \"charm and decorative value\" could not yield first-rate works of art; to accomplish that feat required the power of emotion. \"As between an academician and a Goya, equally skilled,\" she said, \"what makes the difference is the power of emotion in the Goya.\" When, in response to an interviewer's question that year, Caparn called her work \"expression with form,\" she was agreeing with this principle. In 1933, Henry McBride, writing in the New York Sun had compared the emotional effect she achieved with the response listeners feel in a musical performance. She agreed with this point as well, saying, in 1936, that she believed sculpture and music to offer analogous emotional experiences. \"Modernism in sculpture,\" she said, \"is like music in form.\" She was passionate about form but was not seen as a formalist, her style was spare and reserved while remaining expressive. One critic put this aspect of her style in terms of the arch of a cat's back: \"A cat's arched back is a pleasingly rounded shape and well balanced on the foundation of paws. But it is still a cat's back, embodying a cat's peculiar physical response to fear or affection.\" Caparn's sculptures, \"Stalking Cat\" (at right) and \"Standing Bird\" (at left) show her ability to create the expressive forms that critics saw in her work.\n\nCaparn did not carve hard materials to make her sculptures. Rather than cutting away, she built up, modeling in soft materials such as clay, plasticine, plaster, variants of plaster (hydrocal and densite), and a material called \"tattistone\". She made free-standing single subjects and subjects in groups as well as reliefs. Her works on paper were in black and white and pastel. Almost all her pieces were small. Once, she said, she made a six-and-a-half-foot statue, adding, \"It was fun, but too big. I couldn't move it out of the studio.\" Caparn's sculpture, \"The Bear,\" (shown at right) is larger than most of her work, but otherwise quite typical of her style. \"Greyhounds\" (shown at left) is an example of her work in relief. The drawing of foliage (shown at right) is an example of her work on paper. Its subject is reminiscent of her father's landscape photos and plans.\n\nPersonal life and family\n\nCaparn was born on July 18, 1909, in a private resort called Onteora in New York's Catskill Mountains. Caparn's father was Harold ap Rhys Caparn (1863\u20131945). A British immigrant, he was a successful landscape architect and author, known for his work in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the Bronx Zoo, the campus of Brooklyn College, and other public and private gardens. Her mother was Clara Howard Jones (Royall) Caparn (1866\u20131970), a vocalist and successful voice teacher. Clara Caparn began teaching soon after moving to Manhattan in the early 1900s and, using the professional name \"Mrs. C. Howard Royall,\" succeeded in attracting students among the matrons of New York's social elite and their daughters. She also attracted talented, but less wealthy students and for their benefit frequently held performances to raise scholarship funds. In 1939 she created \"An Hour of Music,\" an organization that supported and encouraged young musicians by giving them opportunities to perform in public. She taught until age 85 and died in 1970 at the age of 103. Caparn's parents were married in Manhattan in 1906 after her mother had dissolved a marriage of 1889 to George Claiborne Royall (1860\u20131943), a merchant of Goldsboro, North Carolina.\n\nCaparn had an older sister, Anne Howard Caparn (1907\u20131971), with whom she was close. She had two step-brothers from her mother's first marriage, Kenneth Claiborne Royall (1894\u20131971) and George Claiborne Royall, Jr. (1896\u20131967). Both were raised by their father in Goldsboro, both attended the University of North Carolina, and both served as officers in the U.S. Army. The elder was a lawyer and general in the U.S. Army. Appointed Secretary of the Army in 1947, he oversaw the racial integration of the Army and Air Force. Having returned to private practice he was, in 1963, appointed co-leader of a commission to investigate white-supremicist violence in Birmingham, Alabama. The younger saw service in France during World War I and retired as a Major. He was an investment banker in the 1920s and subsequently held positions in the federal government in Washington, D.C.\n\nAs a child, Caparn enjoyed outdoor life on her family's rustic estate called Fernie Farm in Briarcliff Manor, New York. She later said her childhood ambition was to collect animals, adding that neighbors learned to call her parents when their pets disappeared. A biographer of Caparn's said that in watching her father implement the landscape designs for the property, Caparn \"became aware of her father's enthusiasm for designed space--the positive shape of a tree, the negative shape of the sky, the precise angle of a slope.\" Although the family stayed at Fernie Farm only on weekends and during vacations, Caparn's parents were contributing members of the community. Giving the Briarcliff address as her residence, her mother was founder and president of the Art Alliance of Westchester County. Her father was a member of the Briarcliff municipal board and designer of the village park.\n\nCaparn attended the Brearley School between 1918 and 1927. In 1925 and 1926 she took dance classes from Adeline King Robinson in preparation for her 1927 d\u00e9but in New York society. Complying with social practices of the time, Caparn's mother hosted a series of luncheons in her honor at the Cosmopolitan Club.\n\nAfter graduating from Brearley, Caparn received a prize for academic excellence as a first-year Bryn Mawr student. When, in 1929, the engagement of Caparn's sister Anne was broken off, and when, at the same time, Caparn decided that she did not wish to pursue her education at Bryn Mawr, their mother provided funds for the two women to spend a year in Paris. It was then, as noted above, that she studied under Edouard Navellier.\n\nIn the early 1930s, after she had established herself as a professional sculptor, Caparn met her future husband, Johannes Steel (1908\u20131988).   He had come to her studio to examine the sculpted head she had made of a mutual friend. Although her mother would have liked to give the couple a society wedding, their marriage date was put forward after Steel received an unexpected foreign assignment and the couple departed for London very soon after the ceremony. German-born, Steel came to the United States in 1934 and was naturalized in 1938. An outspoken critic of the Nazi regime, he earned his living as an author, journalist, lecturer, and radio commentator. After World War II, he was investigated and condemned for his Soviet sympathies. Late in life, he wrote news columns on the stock market. In the 1960s he served a year in prison for violating securities laws. Through all the ups and downs of Steel's career, Caparn remained deeply attached to him, and he to her. Steel died in 1988 at 80 years old. His obituary in the New York Times called him \"a newspaperman and radio commentator whose career was marked by controversy over his outspoken left-wing views and his often sensational political and economic predictions.\" In the mid-1960s, when Steel began writing for the News-Times of Danbury, Connecticut, he and Caparn moved first to the nearby community of Newtown and later lived in Danbury. While living in Newtown and Danbury she would write occasional art comments for the same paper.\n\nShe died in Danbury on April 29, 1997, of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n1909 births\n1997 deaths\nAmerican debutantes\nModern artists\nBrearley School alumni\nAmerican women sculptors\n20th-century American women artists"}
{"eng_Latn":"Mother Denmark (Danish: Mor Danmark) is the female personification of Denmark and a patriotic emblem of the Danish nation.\n\nHistory\nAllegorial representations of Denmark as a woman with antique garments and a coat of arms are first seen in the 18th century. In the 19th century, with Romantic Nationalism, it became more common. Writers such as N.F.S. Grundtvig, B. S. Ingemann and Steen Steensen Blicher have all used Mother Denmark as a national symbol of Denmark and a manifestation of national emotions.\n\nIn 1851, under influence of the Danish victory in the Battle of Isted, Elisabeth Jerichau Baumann created a painting of Mother Denmark in the form of a young woman, with a Dannebrog and Viking jewellery, holding an antique sword, walking through a field. The painting became a model for many later depictions of Mother Denmark.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Mother Denmark references grew out of fashion. They have since then mainly been used in caricature drawing.\n\nMonuments and memorials\n \nMany monuments and memorials that commemorate the 1920 Reunification S\u00f8nderjylland with Denmark incorporate a Mother Denmark figure, typically accompanied by a daughter, representing S\u00f8nderjylland.

{"eng_Latn":"Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Goal 10 or Sdg 10) is about reduced inequality and is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015. The full title is: \"Reduce inequality within and among countries\".\n\nThe Goal has ten targets to be achieved by 2030. Progress towards targets will be measured by indicators. The first seven targets are outcome targets: Reduce income inequalities; promote universal social, economic and political inclusion; ensure equal opportunities and end discrimination; adopt fiscal and social policies that promotes equality; improved regulation of global financial markets and institutions; enhanced representation for developing countries in financial institutions; responsible and well-managed migration policies. The other three targets are means of implementation targets: Special and differential treatment for developing countries; encourage development assistance and investment in least developed countries; reduce transaction costs for migrant remittances.\n\nTarget 10.1 is to \"sustain income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average\". This goal, known as \"shared prosperity\", is complementing SDG 1, the eradication of extreme poverty, and it is relevant for all countries in the world. There has been a growth in income for poorer people in 2012\u20132017. Nevertheless, it is common in many countries that \"the bottom 40 per cent of the population receive less than 25 per cent of the overall income\".\n\nA UN report from 2020 pointed out that \"women are more likely to be victims of discrimination than men\". And the situation is even worse for women with disabilities.\n\nBackground \nInequality exist in various forms, such as economic, sex, disability, race, social inequality, and different forms of discrimination. Measuring inequality in its individual forms is a crucial component in order to reduce inequality within and among countries. The Gini coefficient is the most frequently used measurement of socioeconomic inequality as it can significantly show the income and wealth distribution within and among countries.\n\nIssues associated with health, pollution, and environmental justices are often inseparable with inequality. Sometimes these issues also associated with indigenous and aboriginal communities, ethnic minorities and communities of low socio-economic status (SES). Studies of environmental justice shows these communities are irregularly likely to live in environments with higher risk of exposure to pollution and toxic contamination, which possess long-term health and environmental threats.\n\nGlobalization is also accompanied with migration, displacement and dispossession, and this often increased vulnerability of marginalized communities and groups, which negatively shaped their prospects for globalization and emancipation and widened inequality at the meantime. There are also association between inequality and mental and physical health in various forms, such as status anxiety\/competition, social capital, social embeddedness and cohesion.\n\nTargets, indicators and progress \n\nThe UN has defined 10 targets and 11 indicators for SDG 10. Targets specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to track whether these Targets are achieved. SDG 10 covers issues including reducing income inequalities (10.1), promoting universal social, economic and political inclusion (10.2), ensure equal opportunities and end discrimination (10.3), adopt fiscal and social policies that promotes equality (10.4),  improved regulation of global financial markets and institutions (10.5), enhanced representation for developing countries in financial institutions (10.6), responsible and well-managed migration policies (10.7), special and differential treatment for developing countries (10.a), encourage development assistance and investment in least developed countries (10.b) and reduced transaction costs for migrant remittances (10.c).\n\nTarget 10.1: Reduce income inequalities \n\nThe full title of Target 10.1 is: \"By 2030, progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average\".\n\nTarget 10.1 has one indicator: Indicator 10.1.1 is the \"Growth rates of household expenditure or income per capita among the bottom 40 per cent of the population and the total population\".\n\nRelative poverty and inequality is the share of people living below 50 per cent of the median income level. Data from 110 high- and low-income countries showed that the median country had 14 per cent of the population with income levels below that threshold. But both rich and poor countries have high and low levels of inequality. Income inequality is not strongly correlated with either poverty or affluence, suggesting that policies promoting equality and inclusivity have universal relevance.\n\nThere has been a growth in income for poorer people in 2012\u20132017. Nevertheless, it is common in many countries that \"the bottom 40 per cent of the population receive less than 25 per cent of the overall income\".\n\nTarget 10.2: Promote universal social, economic and political inclusion \nThe full title of Target 10.2 is to: \"By 2030, empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status\".\n\nTarget 10.2 has one indicator. Indicator 10.2.1 is the \"Proportion of people living below 50 per cent of median income, by sex, age and persons with disabilities\".\n\nTarget 10.3: Ensure equal opportunities and end discrimination \nThe full title of Target 10.3 is to: \"Ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in this regard\".\n\nTarget 10.3 has one indicator. Indicator 10.3.1 is the \"Proportion of population reporting having personally felt discriminated against or harassed in the previous 12 months on the basis of a ground of discrimination prohibited under international human rights law\".\n\nA UN report from 2020 pointed out that \"women are more likely to be victims of discrimination than men\". And the situation is even worse for women with disabilities.\n\nTarget 10.4: Adopt fiscal and social policies that promote equality \nThe full title of Target 10.4 is to: \"Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection policies, and progressively achieve greater equality\".\n\nTarget 10.4 has one indicator. Indicator 10.4.1 is the \"Labour share of GDP, comprising wages and social protection transfers\".\n\nA UN progress report from 2020 stated that: \"The global labour income share has shown a downward trend since 2004, when it stood at 54 percent, implying that workers are receiving a smaller proportion of the output they helped produce\".\n\nTarget 10.5: Improved regulation of global financial markets and institutions \nThe full title of Target 10.5 is to: \"Improve the regulation and monitoring of global financial markets and institutions and strengthen the implementation of such regulations\".\n\nTarget 10.5 has one indicator. Indicator 10.5.1 is the \"Financial soundness indicator\".\n\nTarget 10.6: Enhanced representation for developing countries in financial institutions \nThe full title of Target 10.6 is to: \"Ensure enhanced representation and voice for developing countries in decision-making in global international economic and financial institutions in order to deliver more effective, credible, accountable and legitimate institutions\".\n\nTarget 10.6 has one indicator. Indicator 10.6.1 is the \"Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international organizations\".\n\nThese indicators measure the share of members and voting rights in international institutions which are held by developing countries.\n\nTarget 10.7: Responsible and well-managed migration policies \nThe full title of Target 10.7 is to: \"Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies\".\n\nTarget 10.7 has two indicators:\n Indicator 10.7.1: Recruitment cost borne by employee as a proportion of yearly income earned in country of destination\n Indicator 10.7.2: Number of countries that have implemented well-managed migration policies\n\nTarget 10.a: Special and differential treatment for developing countries \nThe full title of Target 10.a is to: \"Implement the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, in accordance with World Trade Organization agreements\".\n\nTarget 10.a has one indicator. Indicator 10.a.1 is the \"Proportion of tariff lines applied to imports from least developed countries and developing countries with zero-tariff\".\n\nTarget 10.b: Encourage development assistance and investment in least developed countries\nThe full title of Target 10.b is to: \"Encourage official development assistance and financial flows, including foreign direct investment, to States where the need is greatest, in particular least developed countries, African countries, small island developing States and landlocked developing countries, in accordance with their national plans and programs\".\n\nTarget 10.b has one indicator. Indicator 10.b.1 is the \"Total resource flows for development, by recipient and donor countries and type of flow\".\n\nTarget 10.c: Reduce transaction costs for migrant remittances\nThe full title of Target 10.c is to: \"By 2030, reduce to less than 3 per cent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5 per cent\".\n\nTarget 10.c has one indicator. Indicator 10.c.1 is the \"Remittance costs as a proportion of the amount remitted\".\n\nTarget 10.c is to reduce the transaction costs for migrant remittances to below 3 percent. The target of 3 percent was established as the cost that international migrant workers would pay to send money home (known as remittances). However, post offices and money transfer companies currently charge 6 percent of the amount remitted. Worse, commercial banks charge 11 percent. Prepaid cards and mobile money companies charge 2 to 4 percent, but those services were not widely available as of 2017 in typical \"remittance corridors\".\n\nMonitoring \nAn annual report is prepared by the Secretary-General of the United Nations evaluating the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nLinks with other SDGs \nSDG 10 is linked to many of the other SDGs, such as peaceful and inclusive societies (SDG 16), gender equality (SDG 5), poverty (SDG 1), zero hunger (SDG 2), good health and wellbeing (SDG 3), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11).\n\nChallenges\n\nImpacts of Covid-19 pandemic \nThe COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is making inequality worse. It is hitting the most vulnerable people hardest. Due to the pandemic it is estimated that there will be an increase of more than 6% on average for the Gini Index of emerging markets and developing countries, with a much more devastating effect on the lesser developed countries of the world. The Gini Index is a ratio which is able to determine the income inequality where 0 means that all income is shared equally between all the population and 100 means all the income belongs to a single person.\n\nOrganizations \nOrganizations that work on achieving SDG 10 include:\n IMF\nOECD\nUN\nWEF\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n UN Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform \u2013 SDG 10\n \u201cGlobal Goals\u201d Campaign - SDG 10\n SDG-Track.org - SDG 10\n UN SDG 10 in the US\n\nSustainable Development Goals\n2015 establishments in New York City\nProjects established in 2015\nEquality rights"}

She is an Associate Professor of Medieval History, Fundamentals, and the College at the University of Chicago.\n\nFulton Brown has authored a variety of texts on the topic of Christian studies and the Middle Ages, and a 2019 book chronicling her friendship with far-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos through Yiannopoulos's publishing imprint, Dangerous Books. Fulton Brown has also written for Breitbart. In December 2020, United States president Donald Trump announced an intent to appoint Fulton Brown to the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, which the official Whitehouse website described as a \"key administration post\".\n\nComments and blog entries published by Fulton Brown gained notable attention in academia as part of a broader discussion regarding white nationalism and medieval studies. As described by The New York Times:\nThe idea of medieval studies as a haven for white nationalist ideas gained ground when Rachel Fulton Brown, an associate professor of medieval history at the University of Chicago, began feuding with Dorothy Kim, an assistant professor of medieval English literature at Brandeis, after Dr. Kim, writing on Facebook, highlighted an old blog post of Dr. Fulton Brown\u2019s titled \"Three Cheers for White Men,\" calling it an example of \"medievalists upholding white supremacy.\"\n\nThe article caused a furor, as scholars accused colleagues of providing screenshots of private Facebook conversations and surreptitious recordings of conference sessions to Mr. Yiannopoulos.\nFulton Brown subsequently cited Vox Day, a far-right activist, and promoted a conspiracy theory that the Christchurch mosque shootings may have been a false flag operation. Fulton Brown has often used her tenured status and academic platform to defend Yiannopoloulos, referring to his critics, for example, as \"spineless cunts\".\n\nBibliography\n\n From Judgment to Passion: Devotion to Christ and the Virgin Mary, 800\u20131200. 2005.

{"eng_Latn":"Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3 or Global Goal 3), regarding \"Good Health and Well-being\", is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015. The official wording is: \"To ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.\" The targets of SDG 3 focus on various aspects of healthy life and healthy lifestyle. Progress towards the targets is measured using twenty-one indicators.\n\nSDG 3 has 13 targets and 28 indicators to measure progress toward targets. The first nine targets are outcome targets:\n \n reducing maternal mortality\n ending all preventable deaths under five years of age\n fighting communicable diseases \n reducing mortality from non-communicable diseases and promoting mental health\n preventing and treating substance abuse\n reducing road injuries and deaths\n granting universal access to sexual and reproductive care, family planning and education\n achieving universal health coverage\n reducing illnesses and deaths from hazardous chemicals and pollution. \n\nThe four means of implementation targets are:  \n implementing the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\n supporting research, development, and universal access to affordable vaccines and medicines \n increasing health financing and support the health workforce in developing countries \n improving early warning systems for global health risks.\n\nSDG 3 aims to achieve universal health coverage and equitable access of healthcare services to all men and women. It proposes to end the preventable death of newborns, infants and children under five (child mortality) and end epidemics.\n\nGood health is essential to sustainable development and the 2030 Agenda. It focuses on broader economic and social inequalities, urbanization, climate crisis, and the continuing burden of HIV and other infectious diseases, while not forgetting emerging challenges such as non-communicable diseases. Considering the global pandemic of COVID-19, there is a need to give significant attention to the realization of good health and well-being on a global scale.\n\nProgress has been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common causes of child and maternal mortality. Between 2000 and 2016, the worldwide under-five mortality rate decreased by 47 percent (from 78 deaths per 1,000 live births to 41 deaths per 1,000 live births). Still, the number of children dying under age five is very high: 5.6 million in 2016.\n\nBackground \n\nThe UNDP reports that \"every 2 seconds, someone aged 30 to 70 years dies prematurely from noncommunicable diseases - cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes or cancer.\"\n\nAccording to statistics, globally, \"2.4 million children died in the first month of life in 2019 \u2013 approximately 6,700 neonatal deaths every day \u2013 with about a third of all neonatal deaths occurring within the first day after birth, and close to three-quarters occurring within the first week of life\". Lack of access to quality healthcare is one of the major factors. Neonatal mortality was highest in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia which post 27 and 25 deaths per 1,000 live births, respectively, in 2019.\n\nSignificant steps have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common causes of child and maternal mortality. Between 2000 and 2016, the worldwide under-five mortality rate decreased by 47% (from 78 deaths per 1,000 live births to 41 deaths per 1,000 live births). Still, the number of children dying under age five is extremely high: 5.6 million in 2016 alone.\n\nTargets, indicators, and progress \n\nThe UN has defined 13 Targets and 28 Indicators for SDG 3. The main data source and maps for the indicators for SDG 3 come from Our World in Data's SDG Tracker. The targets of SDG 3 cover a wide range of issues including reduction of maternal mortality (Target 3.1), ending all preventable deaths under five years of age (Target 3.2), fight communicable diseases (Target 3.3), ensure a reduction of mortality from non-communicable diseases and promote mental health (Target 3.4), prevent and treat substance abuse (Target 3.5), reduce road injuries and deaths (Target 3.6), grant universal access to sexual and reproductive health care, family planning and education (Target 3.7), achieve universal health coverage (Target 3.8), reduce illnesses and deaths from hazardous chemicals and pollution (Target 3.9), implement the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (Target 3.a), support research, development and universal access to affordable vaccines and medicines (Target 3.b), increase health financing and support health workforce in developing countries (Target 3.c) and improve early warning systems for global health risks (Target 3.d).\n\nTarget 3.1: Reduce maternal mortality \n\nThe full text of Target 3.1 is: \"By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births\".\n Indicator 3.1.1: Maternal mortality ratio. The maternal mortality ratio refers to the number of women who die from pregnancy-related causes while pregnant or within 42 days of pregnancy termination per 100,000 live births.\n Indicator 3.1.2: Percentage of births attended by personnel trained to give the necessary supervision, care, and advice to women during pregnancy, labour, and the postpartum period; to conduct deliveries on their own; and to care for newborns\n\nTarget 3.1 aims to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births. Though the maternal mortality ratio declined by 37 percent between 2000 and 2015, there were approximately 303,000 maternal deaths worldwide in 2015, most from preventable causes. In 2015, maternal health conditions were also the leading cause of death among girls aged 15\u201319. Key strategies for meeting SDG 3 will be to reduce adolescent pregnancy (which is strongly linked to gender equality), provide better data for all women and girls, and achieve universal coverage of skilled birth attendants.\n\nTarget 3.2: End all preventable deaths under five years of age \n\nThe full text of Target 3.2 is: \"By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under\u20115 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.\"\n Indicator 3.2.1: Under-5 mortality rate. The under-5 mortality rate measures the number of children per 1,000 live births who die before their fifth birthday.\n Indicator 3.2.2: Neonatal mortality rate. The neonatal mortality rate is defined as the share of newborns per 1,000 live births in a given year who die before reaching 28 days of age.\n\nGlobally, there is still a high risk for children dying before age five, even though improvements have been made. There are about 43 child deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015. This means that every day about 16,000 children under the age of five are dying (data from 2015).\n\nImproving antenatal care programs could reduce the neonatal mortality rate.\n\nTarget 3.3: Fight communicable diseases \n\nThe full text of Target 3.3 is: \"By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases.\"\n Indicator 3.3.1: Number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population\n Indicator 3.3.2: Tuberculosis per 100,000 population\n Indicator 3.3.3: Malaria incidence per 1,000 population\n Indicator 3.3.4: Hepatitis B incidence per 100,000 population\n Indicator 3.3.5: Number of people requiring interventions against neglected tropical disease\n\nTarget 3.3 proposes to end the preventable death of newborns and children under five and to end epidemics such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and water-borne diseases, for example.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2016, new HIV infections declined by 66 percent for children under 15 and by 45 percent among adolescents aged 15\u201319.\n\nIn 2015, there were about 142 tuberculosis cases per 100,000 population.\n\nTarget 3.4: Reduce mortality from non-communicable diseases and promote mental health \nThe full text of Target 3.4 is: \"By 2030, reduce by one-third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being.\"\n Indicator 3.4.1: Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease\n Indicator 3.4.2: Suicide mortality rate\n\nDeaths caused by the four main NCDs were \"17.7 million from cardiovascular diseases, 8.8 million from cancers, 3.9 million from chronic respiratory diseases, and 1.6 million from diabetes\".\n\nTarget 3.5: Prevent and treat substance abuse \nThe full text of Target 3.5 is: \"Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol.\"\n Indicator 3.5.1: Coverage of treatment interventions (pharmacological, psychosocial and rehabilitation and aftercare services) for substance use disorders\n Indicator 3.5.2: Harmful use of alcohol, defined according to the national context as alcohol per capita consumption (aged 15 years and older) within a calendar year in litres of pure alcohol.\n\nTarget 3.6: Reduce road injuries and deaths \nThe full text of Target 3.6 is: \"By 2020, halve (50% less) the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents.\"\n\nTarget 3.6 has only one Indicator: Indicator 3.6.1 is the Death rate due to road traffic injuries.\n\nThe need for improvements in safer infrastructure and government regulation continues.

As the pandemic spread worldwide, the lockdown had over 70 countries putting a hold on various health services such as child vaccination, family planning, and cancer screening. The pandemic also led to overloading and overcrowding of health facilities, and many people became afraid of visiting for fear of being infected.\n\nResponses to most non-COVID-19 diseases were either neglected or interrupted during the pandemic, and healthcare systems were in turn stretched beyond their capacity to provide adequate care. This reversed decades of improvement, and has reiterated the need for governments to prioritize issues of healthy living and well-being and work towards the goal of SDG 3.\n\nThe governments of countries who already suffer from health worker shortages and other healthcare system strains can take advantage of the lessons learnt during this crisis to build their resilience against future health pandemics.\n\nLinks with other SDGs \nThe targets of SDG 3 link to targets in other goals: For example to some targets of SDG 2, SDG 4, SDG 5, SDG 6 etc.\n\nOrganizations \nOrganizations dedicated to good health and well-being include:\n The Global Fund to Fight AIDS\n Joint United Nations Program on HIV\/AIDS (UNAIDS)\n World Bank\n World Health Organization (WHO)\n UNICEF\n Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA)\n United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)\n Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\n UN Women\n Gavi the Vaccine Alliance\n Vodafone Foundation\n Doctors Without Borders\n Red Cross International\n Medical IMPACT\n Partners in Health\n PanAfricare\n The Global Health Network\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n UN Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform \u2013 SDG 3\n \u201cGlobal Goals\u201d Campaign - SDG 3\n SDG-Track.org - SDG 3\n UN SDG 3 in the US\n\nSustainable Development Goals\n2015 establishments in New York City\nProjects established in 2015\nHealth campaigns"}

{"eng_Latn":"Ben Bonus (, 1920\u20131984) was a prominent American Yiddish theatre and Broadway actor and Yiddish language singer of the twentieth century. He and his wife Mina Bern were credited with keeping Yiddish theatre alive in United States during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\nBonus was born as Baruch Bonus on November 9, 1920 in Horodenka, Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w Voivodeship, Poland, which had until the end of the First World War been part of Galicia, Austria-Hungary. His parents were Meier Bonus and Sheyne Reyzl \"Rosa\" Katz. His father was a baker who later became a fruit seller. During this time he learned to sing with private lessons. He studied in Cheder until the age of 12 and then studied in the local Polish Gymnasium; during this time he began to perform in children's troupes. For a time he also apparently ran away from home to live in Lvov, singing in courtyards for money, and toured for a bit with Shtshogol's troupe before going home to finish his studies at the Gymnasium. Although his obituary in the New York Times as well as the Lexicon of Yiddish Theatre state that he was brought to the United States in 1929 by an aunt who visited Poland, this appears to be incorrect. He is listed as arriving in the United States in May 1938 on the Polish ship Pilsudski at age 17, under the care of his aunt Mary Schachter, who was a U.S. citizen. His aunt operated a successful bedding business in the Bronx. Bonus's parents and siblings were subsequently killed in the Holocaust in Horodenka.\n\nActing and musical career\nNot long after arriving in the United States, Bonus performed with the Goldfaden Theatre (funded by the International Worker's Order), and started to give concerts and sing Yiddish songs on the radio with Arnold Jaffe. Apparently Bonus learned a lot from the actor Jacob Ben-Ami during this time. Herman Yablokoff also later said in his memoirs that he had been a theatre teacher to Bonus, and had been astonished by his voice at a young age. He also met his first wife, Pepie Bonus (n\u00e9e Sonnenreich) in an acting class; they married in 1940 and were listed in the census of that year as residing in the Bronx with Pepie's two brothers Morris and Jack. That year his first son was born.\n\nIn 1942 he joined the Ben Ami troupe in Detroit (managed by Abraham Littman) and performed the works of Peretz Hirschbein, Henrik Ibsen and Henri Bernstein, and subsequently did a nine-month tour with the Folksbiene in Los Angeles. During this time he also performed for the Jewish Workers' Committee and for the Histadrut. In 1945, Ben's second son Jack Bonus was born. He would go on to play as a session musician in the \"Grateful Dead\" scene. In 1946 Ben founded his own troupe, the \"Yiddish Mobile Theater\". The group was successful and toured over seventy cities.\n\nHe then returned to New York City and started acting in Vaudeville theatre there, including in Israel Rosenberg's theater on Clinton Street. In 1949 he became a member of the Yiddish Actors' Union. In that year he also met his future second wife, Mina Bern, while performing together in a show called \"Shalom, Tel Aviv\". They would end up performing and creating shows together for decades to come. Bonus would divorce his first wife Pepie in 1951 and remarry in 1952.\n\nIn 1952 he became co-manager of the National Yiddish Vaudeville Theatre in New York City with Henrietta Jacobson and Abraham Littman. In the late 1950s, he toured with an artist group funded by the Farbad-Labor Zionist Order, which included Bonus and Mina Bern, Lily Lilliano, Leon Liebgold and the pianist S. Fershko. The troupe continued to tour into the 1960s and a later version added the comedian Shmulik Goldstein and the pianist Paula Kadison. The group toured South America for a number of years as the Farband Players, visiting Chile, Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Venezuela.\n\nIt was only in 1964 that Bonus returned to New York City and started performing there regularly again. In 1966 he established a Yiddish language theater in the Borough Park Theater in Brooklyn. That same year he performed on Broadway with \"Let's Sing Yiddish\", a revue of various songs by Itsik Manger, Mordecai Gebirtig, Morris Rosenfeld and others, staged by Mina Bern. The following year he performed his act \"Sing, Israel, Sing\". In 1970 he performed \"Light, Lively and Yiddish\" on Broadway.\n\nBonus died unexpectedly on the street in Miami on April 6, 1984.\n\nDiscography\nSongs of Our People (Tikva Records T-23) (1950s?)\nBen Bonus Sings Israeli Songs in Yiddish - Sing Israel Sing!

Her most notable work, Environ A or the Plastic House, was a prototype for efficient, affordable, prefabricated housing in the mid-twentieth century that made early use of plastics as an architectural material.\n\nEarly life and education \nValeria Stupnitsky was born on May 19, 1936, in Kharkiv, Ukraine. She moved with her family to Bavaria, Venezuela, and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Stupnitsky studied architecture in Venezuela before receiving her bachelor's degree in architecture from the University of Minnesota in 1959. Following a Fulbright Fellowship in Spain spent studying architectural history, she attended Yale University, where she received a Masters of Environmental Design in 1969.\n\nCareer \nBatorewicz came to Yale intent on studying housing issues, and was first supported by a $1,250 grant from the Center Church-on-the-Green in New Haven. The Church had previously collaborated with Yale on developing experimental housing as a form of social action. In 1968, Batorewicz received an additional grant of $10,000 from Yale to study problems in housing, followed by two additional $5,000 grants from the First Church of Christ and its Ladies Home Missionary Society.\n\nEnviron A, the resulting house, was constructed in the Westville neighborhood of New Haven, Connecticut and finished in 1972. It utilized a central core that contained the bathroom and kitchen plumbing, a small electrical furnace, and a stairway. Each room in the house, which Batorewicz referred to as \"satellites,\" was then attached to the core. Each satellite's roof was both curved and slanted to account for its construction in fiberglass-reinforced plastic sprayed with isocyanurate foam insulation and to prevent the accumulation of snow. A cement-resin material applied after made the house waterproof. Environ A contains a master bedroom, kitchen, family room, office, music room, and second-story living room, each with variable lengths but a common width of 11 feet 4 inches.\n\nAt the time of its construction, Environ A could be ordered from Housing Systems Corporation at a cost of $25,000, or about $22 per square foot.\n\nPersonal life \nValeria married Wadim Batorewicz (1934\u20132017), a chemist who received a PhD from the University of Minnesota and became a senior research scientist at Uniroyal Chemical Company, where he specialized in industrial polymer research.\n\nReferences \n\n20th-century American architects\nAmerican women architects\nArchitects from New Haven, Connecticut\n1936 births\n1983 deaths\n20th-century American women"}

{"eng_Latn":"Edith L. Williams (August 17, 1887 \u2013 June 9, 1987) was a United States Virgin Islands educator, women's rights activist, and suffragist. Williams was the first woman who attempted to vote in the Virgin Islands and when she was denied the right to register, she petitioned the court along with Eulalie Stevens and Anna M. Vessup to review their qualifications. They won their case and subsequently women throughout the Virgin Islands who were literate and property owners were allowed to vote. A bust of Williams was installed in the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Veterans Memorial Park in Charlotte Amalie, and the James Madison Elementary School was renamed as the Edith L. Williams School in 1981 in her honor.\n\nEarly life and education\nEdith L. Williams was born on August 17, 1887, on the island of Saint Thomas in the Danish Virgin Islands. Both of her parents had been born on Saint Croix. During her youth, she played cricket for the Harlem Virgin Islands Girls team and traveled several times to compete in matches in the United States. She was both a batter and a bowler in cricket, and also helped organize a girls' soft ball team in St. Thomas.  Williams completed her education at the age of 13 in the missionary schools run by the Moravian Church.\n\nCareer\nIn 1900, Williams began teaching at the Moravian Town School in Charlotte Amalie. Early in her career, she had joined with other women to work on issues which would improve the lives of teachers and their students. They formed the St. Thomas Teachers' Association and worked to establish a Teachers' Institute to train candidates and improve the education of those already in the teaching profession. Members of the Association later voluntarily taught students who wanted to continue their education beyond the mandatory 9th school grade and were instrumental in graduating the first high school students in 1931 and establishing high school education on the island.\n\nWilliams transferred to George Washington Elementary School from the Moravian School in 1917. In that year, the Danish West Indies was sold to the United States and the Colonial Law of 1906 passed by Denmark for governance in the islands was retained for the unincorporated territory. When women in the United States gained the right to vote in 1920 through the Nineteenth Amendment, it was widely believed that Virgin Islands women already had suffrage by virtue of the 1915 extension of the franchise to Danish women. In 1921, the U.S. Supreme Court clarified that constitutional rights did not extend to residents of either Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands, as they were defined in Puerto Rico by the Organic Act of 1900 and in the Virgin Islands by the Danish Colonial Law of 1906. In 1922 Williams began teaching at Dober Elementary School, which had formerly been known as Vestergade School and Ulysses S. Grant School, in Savan.\n\nTransferred to James Madison School in 1928, Williams became the school principal in 1932. While heading Madison, she created the first school lunch program in the Virgin Islands. Teaching students and their parents how to garden, she created a vegetable patch on the school grounds, allowing them to grow their own food, prepare it for lunches, and sell the excess produce. Williams owned her own home on Hospital Grounds Road in Charlotte Amalie and walked to her teaching post at Madison every day.\n\nIn 1931, the territory, which had been administrated by the United States Navy, was turned over to civilian governance. Virgin Islands women felt that they would be granted suffrage when citizenship was given to people in the territory in 1932, but voting rights did not occur. Urged on by businesswoman Ella Gifft, Williams, Bertha C. Boschulte, and Eulalie Stevens joined to fight for suffrage. Each of them had ties to educational activities and the suffrage movement in the United States. They were aware of developments in Puerto Rico led by Milagros Benet de Mewton to gain enfranchisement there in 1929.\n\nIn 1935, Elsie Hill, a former suffragist and wife of Judge Albert Levitt, encouraged Boschulte, secretary of the Teachers' Association, and other association members to challenge their voting exclusion. The Association filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Virgin Islands in November 1935 and Levitt ruled that Danish Colonial Law was unconstitutional, as it contravened the provisions of the Nineteenth Amendment, and had never been intended to restrict the vote to men. The following month, Williams became the first woman to register to vote and was quickly followed by nearly two dozen other women. The Board of Elections rejected all of the women registrants, causing Hill to arrange for the pro bono services of lawyer, Robert Claiborne. Choosing Williams, Eulalie Stevens, and Anna M. Vessup as petitioners, the Teachers' Association sought to obtain a Writ Of Mandamus, a type of court order, compelling the election officers to allow the women's registrations. The three women were chosen because, except for their gender, they met the age, income, literacy, property, and respectability requirements for any other voter. Once again Levitt ruled in their favor, allowing qualified women to vote in the 1936 election. Their success led to mobilization to register to vote in Saint Croix and Saint John and led to universal suffrage in 1938.\n\nWilliams' last post was at Thomas Jefferson Elementary, where she was assigned in 1937. She remained there until her retirement in 1945. She was honored for her service with a commendation from the Legislature of the Virgin Islands in 1974. In 1981, the James Madison Elementary School was renamed as the Edith L. Williams Elementary School in recognition of her service to the Virgin Islands and the following year, she became the first person inducted into the Virgin Islands Education Review Hall of Fame.\n\nDeath and legacy\nWilliams died on June 9, 1987, in Charlotte Amalie. Often referred to as the \"Mother of Education\" in the Virgin Islands, according to Rosalyn Terborg-Penn, she is recognized widely not only for her pioneering role in education, but for her community service and her quest to attain suffrage. A statue of Williams was installed in the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Veterans Memorial Park in Charlotte Amalie. Mounted on a pillar, a bust of her upper torso depicts her holding a book in her left hand and a coal pot in the right. It bears the inscription: \"Feed not only the body, the mind must also be nourished\".\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1887 births\n1987 deaths\nPeople from the Danish West Indies\nUnited States Virgin Islands activists\nAfrican-American feminists\nAmerican feminists\nAfrican-American suffragists\nAmerican suffragists\n20th-century American educators\nUnited States Virgin Islands educators\nAfrican-American schoolteachers\n20th-century American women educators\n20th-century African-American women"}

{"eng_Latn":"Islamic feminist views on dress codes include views on issues surrounding women's dress codes in Islam, especially on the hijab and niq\u0101b.\n\nIslam requires women to wear a headscarf, also known as the hijab. Hijab traditionally refers to a type of veiling which covers the skin from the hair to the chest. Niq\u0101b refers to a cloth that covers the face as a part of sartorial hijab. There are mixed opinions among Muslim feminists regarding the merits of veiling.\n\nHistory \nThe Qur'an states that men and women should be dressed modestly (33:59-60, 24:30-31; in translation by Ali, 1988, 1126\u201327). However, it does not use the words veil, hijab, burqa, chador, or abaya. Instead, it uses the words jilbab (cloak) and khumur (shawl). These garments do not cover the face, hands, or feet.\n\nUntil the third through the ninth centuries (Hijri) women prayed in mosques unveiled.\n\nCommunity Interpretations \nSufi groups such as Al-Ahbash do not make it mandatory for women to wear traditional Islamic clothing, even allowing jeans.\n\nViews in support of hijab or emphasizing freedom of choice\n\nMany Muslim feminists today see the veil as a symbol of Islamic freedom or otherwise attribute a personalized meaning to it. \n\nFeminists such as Leila Ahmed say the veil no longer represents \"a woman's brainwashed submissiveness or at the very least her lack of choice\" and note that many American Muslims have worn the hijab to show opposition to anti-Muslim discrimination following the September 11 attacks or to show solidarity with Palestine. \n\nSince 2012, the hijab has become more prominent in countries around the world where state law does not require women to wear the hijab. For some of these women the hijab acts as a statement of pride in Islam, femininity, and sexual identity rather than as a representation of the oppression of women. Feminist philosophers such as Luce Irigaray note that the veil can take on the role of empowerment regarding a woman's sexual difference from man.\n\nSome feminists link the freedom to wear the hijab to women having a right over their own body. Publicist Nadiya Takolia adopted the hijab after becoming a feminist, saying the hijab \"is not about protection from men's lusts,\" but about \"telling the world that my femininity is not available for public consumption...and I don't want to be part of a system that reduces and demeans women.\"\n\nMany modern Muslim feminists believe a woman's freedom of choice is the most important thing and that she should be able to choose whether to wear the veil or not without being coerced or threatened. This view is in accordance with a Muslim feminist's personal expression of Islamic faith, Muslim women should be able to define dress codes for themselves and what they deem to personally empower them.\n\nViews in opposition to hijab \nWomen in opposition to the hijab claim that whole body covering with the burka, chador, and other items of clothing is a cultural tradition that arose from a conservative reading of the Qur'an by male mullahs, and that the Qur'an itself does not require such covering.\n\nA section of Muslim feminists, including Fadela Amara and , do support bans on the hijab due to their view that the hijab inherently represents a subjugation of women. Amara supported France's ban of the garment in public buildings, saying \"the veil is the visible symbol of the subjugation of women, and therefore has no place in the mixed, secular spaces of France's public school system.\" She also pointed to the fact that feminists in Algeria fought against wearing the veil, accusing those who criticized the ban as participating in neocolonialism. Mhenni expressed support for Tunisia's ban on the veil on similar grounds, claiming that acceptance of the veil would lead to acceptance of women's rights being limited.\n\nSihem Habchi, director of the French feminist movement Ni Putes Ni Soumises, expressed support for France's ban on the burqa in public places, stating that the ban was a matter of \"democratic principle\" and protecting French women from the \"obscurantist, fascist, right-wing movement\" that she said the burqa represented.\n\nSee also \n Awrah\n Haya (Islam)\n Hermeneutics of feminism in Islam\n Hijab by country\n Nazira Zain al-Din\n Purdah\n Types of hijab\n\nBibliography\n\nReferences \n\nQuranic exegesis\nHermeneutics\nIslamic feminism\nWomen's rights in Islam\nIslamic literature\nIslamic studies\nFeminist theory\nFeminist ethics\nHijab\nClothing controversies\nFeminism in the Middle East\nFeminism in the Arab world"}

{"eng_Latn":"Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators' Association, 460 U.S. 37 (1983), was a United States Supreme Court decision concerning free speech rights on government-owned property. The Court ruled that teacher mailboxes and the use of a school mail delivery system are a nonpublic forum, and upheld a policy that allowed the union representing the teachers, but not other employee organizations, to use the district's mail system.\n\nPerry Education Association is commonly cited for its explanation of the rules distinguishing the public forum, the designated public forum, and the nonpublic forum.\n\nBackground \n\nTwo rival unions were in competition to represent the teachers of Perry Township Schools in Indiana: the Perry Education Association (PEA) and the Perry Local Educators' Association (PLEA). In 1977, PEA won an election and was certified as the exclusive bargaining representative for the district's teachers.\n\nFollowing the election, PEA negotiated a labor contract with the district. Among other things, this contract gave PEA the right to place material in teachers' mailboxes and to use the interschool mail delivery system. Mail access rights were given exclusively to PEA, and could not be used by any other \"school employee organization.\"\n\nPLEA, the rival organization, could not use teacher mailboxes or the school mail system. However, PLEA was not prevented from posting notices on bulletin boards, holding meetings on school property, or making announcements on the public address system. In addition, under Indiana law, PLEA was assured of equal access to all modes of communication during election periods.\n\nPLEA filed a civil suit against PEA under \u00a71983, claiming that the mail access policy violated PLEA's First Amendment rights. The Seventh Circuit sided with PLEA, ruling that there was no basis for denying PLEA mail access.\n\nOpinion of the Court \n\nIn a 5\u20134 decision, the Supreme Court reversed the Seventh Circuit and upheld the mail access policy.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Byron White analyzed the three types of forums that arise when speakers use government-owned property to convey a message:\n\nA public forum is a public place, such as a street or park, that \"time out of mind, [has] been used\" for expressive purposes. In the traditional public forum, speech restrictions must be content-neutral, be narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.\n A designated public forum is \"public property which the State has opened for use by the public as a place for expressive activity.\" Although the government is not required to open or maintain a designated public forum, as long as such a forum exists the government is \"bound by the same standards as apply in a traditional public forum.\"\n Finally, a nonpublic forum is not open to the public for expressive purposes, although speakers may gain access by the government's invitation or permission. In a nonpublic forum, government may not discriminate according to viewpoint, but it may \"draw distinctions which relate to the special purpose for which the property is used.\"\n\nThe Court concluded that the school mail system was a nonpublic forum. Although other organizations such as the Cub Scouts and the YMCA were at times permitted to use the mail facilities, this was done with the permission of the building principal. Such \"selective access does not transform government property into a public forum.\"\n\nNext, the Court ruled that PEA's preferential access was a reasonable distinction based on status, not viewpoint. Distinctions based on \"subject matter and speaker identity\" are \"inescapable in the process of limiting a nonpublic forum to activities compatible with the intended purpose of the property.\" There was no evidence that PEA's favorable treatment was a consequence of different viewpoints on labor or any other issue. Rather, the unequal treatment simply reflected PEA's \"special responsibilities\" as the exclusive bargaining agent for teachers.\n\nThe majority also found that the restriction was reasonable because \"substantial alternative channels ... remain[ed] open\" for PLEA to communicate with teachers. These channels included bulletin boards, the United States mail, and the use of school mail facilities during election periods.\n\nJustice William Brennan dissented, arguing that the mail policy was a form of viewpoint discrimination. Viewpoint discrimination is impermissible even in a nonpublic forum.\n\nSee also \n\n List of United States Supreme Court cases\n List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 460\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1983 in United States case law\nUnited States Free Speech Clause case law\nUnited States Supreme Court cases\nUnited States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court"}

{"eng_Latn":"Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8 or Global Goal 8) is about \"decent work and economic growth\" and  is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals which were established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. The full title is to \"Foster sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.\" Progress towards targets will be measured, monitored and evaluated by 17 indicators.\n\nSDG 8 has twelve targets in total to be achieved by 2030. Some targets are for 2030; others are for 2020. The first ten are outcome targets. These are; \"sustainable economic growth; diversify, innovate and upgrade for economic productivity\", \"promote policies to support job creation and growing enterprises\", \"improve resource efficiency in consumption and production\", 'full employment and decent work with equal pay', 'promote youth employment, education and training', 'end modern slavery, trafficking, and child labour', 'protect labour rights and promote safe working environments', 'promote beneficial and sustainable tourism', universal access to banking, insurance and financial services. In addition, there are also two targets for means of implementation, which are: Increase aid for trade support; develop a global youth employment strategy.\n\nFor the least developed countries, the economic target is to attain at least a 7 percent annual growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In 2018, the global growth rate of real GDP per capita was 2 per cent.\n\nOver the past five years, economic growth in least developed countries has been increasing at an average rate of 4.3 per cent. In 2019, 22 per cent of the world's young people were not in employment, education or training.\n\nBackground \n\nFor close to three decades, the number of workers living in extreme poverty has reduced drastically. This is despite the lasting impact of the 2008 economic crisis and global recession. In developing countries, 34 per cent of total employments were for the middle class, a number that has increased rapidly between 1991 and 2015.\n\nEmployment growth since 2008 has \"averaged only 0.1% annually, compared with 0.9% between 2000 and 2007\".\n\nSDG 8 aims at fostering sustainable and equitable economic growth for all workers, irrespective of their background, race or gender. This means achieving \"higher levels of economic productivity through product diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors.\"\n\nTargets, indicators and progress \n\nThe UN has defined the 12 Targets and 17 Indicators for SDG 8. The 12 Targets specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to track whether these targets are achieved by using the years stated and documented for the indicators actualisation. Two of the indicators are to be achieved by the year 2020, one by the year 2025, and the remaining fourteen indicators are to be achieved by 2030.\n\nTarget 8.1: Sustainable economic growth \n\nThe full title of Target 8.1 is: \"Sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least 7 per cent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries\".\n\nIt has one indicator: Indicator 8.1.1 is the \"Annual growth rate of real GDP per capita\".\n\nAchieving higher productivity will require diversification and upgraded technology along with innovation, entrepreneurship, and the growth of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nIn 2018, the global growth rate of real GDP per capita was 2 per cent.\n\nTarget 8.2: Diversify, innovate and upgrade for economic productivity \n\nThe official wording for Target 8.2 is: \"Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors.\"\n\nIt has one indicator: Indicator 8.2.1 is the \"Annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person\".\n\nA large portion of North America (Canada and the United States) had an average 0.5% increase in GDP per employed person, but overall, the continent had an approximate -0.53% decrease in productivity. South America had an overall decrease in GDP per employed person, with Venezuela experiencing the largest change at -31.8%. The continent overall met an approximate -2.56% decrease in productivity.\n\nAsia had an overall increase in GDP per employed person. It had an approximate 2.1% increase in GDP per employed person with a large portion (China) seeing a 6.6% increase. Europe had an overall increase in GDP per employed person. It had an approximate 1.3% increase with a large portion (Russia) seeing a 2.5% increase. Africa had an overall increase in GDP per employed person. It had an approximate 0.4% increase. Oceania had an overall increase in GDP per employed person. It had an approximate 0.85% increase with a large portion (Australia) seeing a 0.2% increase.\n\nTarget 8.3: Promote policies to support job creation and growing enterprises \n\nThe official wording for Target 8.3 is: \"Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation.\"\n\nIt has one indicator: Indicator 8.3.1 is the \"Proportion of informal employment in non-agriculture employment, by sex\".\n\nJobs that fall under the Informal employment in non-agricultural employment include; unregistered and\/or small-scale private unincorporated enterprises engaged in the production of goods or services meant for sale or barter, self-employed street vendors, taxi drivers and home-base workers, irrespective of size.\n\nTarget 8.4: Improve resource efficiency in consumption and production \n\nThe official title of Target 8.4 is: \"Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10\u2011Year Framework of Programs on Sustainable Consumption and Production, with developed countries taking the lead.\"\n\nIt has two indicators:\nIndicator 8.4.1: Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP\nIndicator 8.4.2: Domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and domestic material consumption per GDP\n\nThe total material footprint is the sum of the material footprint for biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metal ores. Data on material footprints are outdated and unavailable after the year 2010. Material footprint per capita has had an increase of 39 per cent from the year 2000 to 2017 reaching 12.18 tonnes and material footprint per unit of GDP has had an increase of 7 percent from the year 2000 to 2017 reaching 1.16\u00a0kg.\n\nDomestic material consumption per capita has increased by 11 per cent from 2010 to 2017 reaching 12.17 tonnes and domestic material consumption per unit of GDP has not increased between 2010 and 2017 staying at a value of 1.16\u00a0kg.\n\nTarget 8.5: Full employment and decent work with equal pay \n\nThe full title for Target 8.5 is: \"By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value\".\n\nTarget 8.5 has two indicators:\n Indicator 8.5.1: Average hourly earnings of female and male employees, by occupation, age and persons with disabilities\n Indicator 8.5.2: Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities\n\nAverage earnings are reported for male and female employees, but not available across countries for further breakdowns. In 2017, \"a factor-weighted gender pay gap of 19 per cent was determined\".\n\nTarget 8.6: Promote youth employment, education and training \n\nThe full title for Target 8.6 is: \"By 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training\". Unlike most SDG targets set for the year 2030, this is set to be achieved by 2020.\n\nIt has one indicator. Indicator 8.6.1 is the \"Proportion of youth (aged 15\u201324 years) not in education, employment or training\".\n\nMost SDGs are either set to be reached by 2020 or 2030. While SDG 8, is due in 2030 target 8.6 has already expired in 2020.\n\nIn 2019, \"22 per cent of the world's young people were not in employment, education or training, a figure that has hardly changed since 2005\".\n\nIn Canada, over the years there has been a slight decrease in the number of youths not associated with education, employment and or training (NEET).\u00a0 The NEET rates in 1975 were 18% and in 2020, the NEET rates were 20%.\n\nWhile there has been progress in many North American and European Countries, this is not the case for most African countries. As the NEET rates for youth in the majority of African countries are higher today than in 2015 (when the SDGs were originally implemented).\n\nYouth that is NEET, are more likely to have adverse effects on their emotional, physical and psychosocial wellbeing. The lack of decent employment can also contribute to exacerbating global issues such as poverty and mass migration.\n\nTarget 8.7: End modern slavery, trafficking, and child labour \nThe full title for Target 8.7 is \"Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms\".\n\nThere is one indicator: Indicator 8.7.1 is the \"Proportion and number of children aged 5\u201317 years engaged in child labour, by sex and age\".\n\nTarget 8.8: Protect labour rights and promote safe working environments \n\nThe full title of the Target 8.8 is: \"Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment\".\n\nIt has two indicators:\n Indicator 8.8.1: Frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries, by sex and migrant status\n Indicator 8.8.2: Level of national compliance with labour rights (freedom of association and collective bargaining) based on International Labour Organization (ILO) textual sources and national legislation, by sex and migrant status\n\nTarget 8.9: Promote beneficial and sustainable tourism \nThe full text for Target 8.9 is \"By 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products.\"\n\nIt has two indicators:\n Indicator 8.9.1: Tourism direct GDP as a proportion of total GDP and in growth rate\n Indicator 8.9.2: The proportion of jobs in sustainable tourism industries out of total tourism jobs\nA proposal has been tabled in 2020 to delete Indicator 8.9.2.\n\nEvery country will be able to generate income as it aims at improving its tourist attraction.\n\nThe United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) defines sustainable tourism as \u201ctourism that takes full account of its current and future economic, social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors, the industry, the environment, and host communities\u201d\n\nTarget 8.10: Universal access to banking, insurance and financial services \n\nThe official text for Target 8.10 is: \"Strengthen the capacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and expand access to banking, insurance and financial services for all\".\n\nTarget 8.10 has two indicators:\n Indicator 8.10.1: Number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults and (b) number of automated teller machines (ATMs) per 100,000 adults\n Indicator 8.10.2: Proportion of adults (15 years and older) with an account at a bank or other financial institution or with a mobile-money-service provider\n\nTarget 8.a: Increase aid for trade support \n\nThe official wording for Target 8.a \"Increase Aid for Trade support for developing countries, in particular, least developed countries, including through the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries.\"\n\nIt has one indicator. Indicator 8.a.1 is the \"Aid for Trade commitments and disbursements\".\n\nThe indicator 8.a.1 is measured as total Official Development Assistance (ODA) allocated to aid for trade in 2015 US$.\n\nIn 2018, \"aid for trade commitments remained stable, at $58 billion, based on current prices\". South and Central Asia \"received the highest share thereof (31.4 per cent), followed by sub-Saharan Africa (29.2 per cent)\".\n\nTarget 8.b: Develop a global youth employment strategy \n\nThe full title of Target 8.b is: \"By 2020, develop and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment and implement the Global Jobs Pact of the International Labour Organization\".\n\nIt has one indicator: Indicator 8.b.1 is the \"Existence of a developed and operationalized national strategy for youth employment\".\n\nUnlike most SDG targets with a target for 2030, the goal date for this indicator is 2020. According to data for 2019, 98 per cent of the countries surveyed had a youth employment strategy or a plan to develop one in the near future. ILO as the agency for this indicator is in charge of the data gathering for the progress of Global Youth Empowerment Strategy.\n\nCustodian agencies \nCustodian agencies are in charge of reporting on the following indicators:\n\n Indicator 8.1.1: United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN-DESA) and United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD). \n Indicators 8.2.1, 8.3.1,8.5.1, 8.5.2, 8.6.1, 8.8.1, 8.8.2 and 8.b.1: International Labour Organisation (ILO).\n Indicators 8.4.1 and 8.4.2: United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\n Indicator 8.7.1: The International Labour Organisation (ILO) and United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF). \n Indicators 8.9.1 and 8.9.2: United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).\n Indicator 8.10.1: International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n Indicator 8.10.2: World Bank (WB).\n Indicator 8.a.1: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nMonitoring \nHigh-level progress reports for all the SDGs are published in the form of reports by the United Nations Secretary General; the most recent is from April 2021.\n\nLinks with other SDGs \n\nThe attainment of SDG 8 is vested on the success and progress of other SDGs. There cannot be growth in the economy of any country if its citizens are not well educated. Therefore, SDG 8; Decent Work and Economic Growth interlinks with Quality Education (SDG 4), Gender Equality (SDG 5) for equal work opportunities. There are also strong ties with Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG 9) and Responsible consumption and production (SDG 12).\n\nOrganizations\n\nUN system \n World Bank Group: Since the inception of the Global Goals, The World Bank has been in support with the vision to alleviate poverty and empower both gender through its training, resources mobilisation and others.\nUnited Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA)\nInternational Labour Organisation\nUN Women acts to \"achieve economic rights and growth for all by promoting decent work, equal pay for equal work, equal access to economic assets and opportunities, and the fair distribution of unpaid care work\".\nUnited Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)\n\nChallenges\n\nImpacts of COVID-19 pandemic \nWith companies shutting down and small scale business being affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic it is reported that chances of employment will continue to decrease.\n\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has reduced the growth of every economy in the world, including every sector like banking, insurance and services. Other sectors such as tourism, are also facing challenges and the GDP per capita is expected to drop by 4.2% this period.\n\nCriticism\nSeveral researchers have noted that continued global economic growth of 3 percent (Goal 8.1) may not be reconcilable with the ecological sustainability SDGs (6, 12, 13, 14, and 15), because the required rate of absolute global eco-economic decoupling is far higher than any country has achieved in the past. According to antropologist Jason Hickel, it may also conflict with other non-environmental goals as well; for example, SDG 1 (no poverty) may become unachievable if economic development leads to most jobs becoming fully automated, which may be easier in the developing countries' crucial manufacturing sector. In light of this, he proposes eliminating Goal 8.1 and modifying other goals, such as SDGs 8.4 and 10 (reduced income inequality) to make them quantitative and explicitly oriented toward sustainability and social welfare.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nSustainable Development Knowledge Platform (Goal 8)\nUnited Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA)\nSDG Watch Europe & Friends of the Earth Europe\n\u201cGlobal Goals\u201d Campaign - SDG 8 \nSDG-Track.org - SDG 8\nUN SDG 8 in the US\n\nSustainable Development Goals\n2015 establishments in New York City\nProjects established in 2015\nEconomic growth\nRight to work"}
